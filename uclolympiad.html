      <h2>What are Maths Battles and Maths Circles?</h2>
<p>
A <a href="/maths-battle/">maths battle</a> is a competition between two opposing teams.  Children solve a given set of problems with their team first, 
and subsequently present their solutions in turns at the whiteboard to the scrutiny of the other team. You can find <a href="http://wesolveproblems.org.uk/maths-battle/simplified-rules.html">the rules for maths battles here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To perform better in “battles”, children are asked to attend regular training session, namely “maths circles”. 
This is done similar to sport competitions between schools, in which children are asked to attend training sessions in order 
to be able to represent their school.
</p>
<p>
While the “circles” form the backbone of our program, we rely on “battles” to generate interest and “buzz” around the curriculum.

      <h2>What is the target age of children for maths battles?</h2>
<p>
We aim to work with secondary school children from the age of 11.  At the moment we divide children according to their year group:  
Year 7-8, and Year 9-10.  We found that the younger children are the most enthusiastic, and we are working hard to preserve their 
interest in maths when they grow older.

      <h2>Background and vision</h2>
<p>
WeSolveProblems is an educational non-profit organization, founded by three enthusiasts (you can read about us at <a href="http://wesolveproblems.org.uk/about.html">the About page</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Our aim is to organize <b>maths competitions</b> (<a href="/maths-battle/">Maths battles</a>) among UK schools, and provide <b>weekly training</b> (Maths Circles)
for the competitions. 
The training is done in so-called maths circles, which are run on weekly basis. Maths competitions are organized every half term.
</p>
Our primary <b>aim</b> is to encourage <b>creative mathematical thinking</b> and to develop a skill in <b>communicating
mathematical ideas</b>. 
One can consider the maths battles as an analogue of debating competitions but within the mathematical context. 
</p>
<p>Maths battles create <b>natural environment</b>, which we use to teach children how <b>to prove mathematical statements</b>.
</p>
<p>
Our dream ambition is to establish a Maths Battle League.
