<h1>Problem ID 61013</h1>
<p>
Prove that if $(p, q) = 1$ and p/q is a rational root of the polynomial $P (x) = a_nx^n + ... + a_1x + a_0$ with integer coefficients, then
<p>
a)	$a_0$ is divisible by p;
<p>
   b) $a_n$ is divisible by q.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The condition $f (p/q) = 0$ can be written in the form $a_0q^n + a_1pq^{n-1} + ... + a_np^n = 0$. All of the terms on the left-hand side are multiples of p except for the first, hence $a_0q^n$ is divisible by p. But p and q are relatively prime, hence $a_0$ is divisible by p. Similarly, we prove that $a_n$ is a multiple of q.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above. 

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
These relations allow us to list all of the rational numbers that can be the roots of a given polynomial.
