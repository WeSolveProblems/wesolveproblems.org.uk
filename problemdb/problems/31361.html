<h1>Problem ID 30434</h1>
<p>
There are three groups of stones: in the first - 10, in the second - 15, in the third - 20. During one turn you are allowed to split any pile into two smaller ones; the one who can not make a move loses.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<P>
After each move, the number of piles increases by 1. First, there were 3, and at the end - 45. Thus, everything will be done in 42 moves. The last player to win will be the one that has the 42nd move, which will be the second player.
