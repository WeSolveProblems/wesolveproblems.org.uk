<h1>Problem ID 30428</h1> <p>
Prove that a graph with n vertices, the degree of each of which is at least $\frac{n-1}{2}, is connected.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  Consider two arbitrary vertices and assume that they are not connected by a path, that is, a sequence of edges in which the beginning of the next edge coincides with the end of the previous one. Each of these two vertices is, by hypothesis, connected to at least $\frac{n-1}{2} others; all of the vertices mentioned are different - after all, if some two of them coincide, that is, a path that connects the original vertices.
  Thus, in the graph there are at least $\frac{n-1}{2}+ $\frac{n-1}{2} + 2 = n + 1 vertices. This is a contradiction.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
