<h1>Problem ID 35501</h1>
<p>
Arrows are placed on the sides of a polygon.
Prove that the number of vertices in which two arrows converge is equal to the number of vertices from which two arrows emerge.


<p>

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The number of emerging arrows is equal to the number of vertices of the polygon.

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let n be the number of sides of the given polygon, and let k be the number of vertices where two arrows converge. In total, the number of arrows is n, of which 2k arrows converge at the given k vertices, and the remaining n - 2k arrows converge at the n - 2k vertices $($one in each$)$. Now, n - k - $($n - 2k$)$ = k vertices remain, where no arrows converge, that is, where two arrows emerge.
