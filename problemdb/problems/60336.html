<h1>Problem ID 60336</h1>
<p>
How many different seven-digit numbers exist $($it is assumed that the number cannot start with zero$)$?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Solution 1
<p>
The first digit can be selected in 9 ways, and each of the other six - in 10 ways. In total, we have $9 \times 10^6$ ways.
<p>
Solution 2
<p>
There are as many such numbers as there are seven-digit numbers. The largest seven-digit number is 9999999 and the largest six-digit number is 999999. Therefore, in total there are 9999999 - 999999 = 9000000 seven-digit numbers.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
$9 \times 10^6$ numbers.
