<h1>Problem ID 30446</h1>
<p>
There is a board of $10 \times 10$ squares. Consider the game with two players where: in one turn a player is allowed to cover any two adjacent squares with a domino (a $1 \times 2$ rectangle) so that the domino doesnt cover another domino. The loser is the one who cannot make a move. Which player would win, if the right strategy was used?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The second player wins by using central symmetry.
