<h1>Problem ID 88044</h1>
<p>
  Four girls went to an ice rink, each with her brother. The group split themselves into pairs, each consisting of a boy and a girl, and start skating together. It turned out that no girl was skating with her brother and that the boy was always taller than the girl in each pair. The tallest in the group was James Sparrow, followed by Andrew Scott, Lucy Scott, Samuel Peters, Olivia Peters, David Smith, Elizabeth Smith, and Anna Sparrow. Deduce who skated with whom.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Who skated with Lucy Scott, the tallest girl?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  The tallest girl was Lucy Scott, and by the conditions given she had to have skated with a boy taller than her. There are two such boys but one is her brother, meaning Lucy Scott must have skated with James Sparrow. Using similar reasoning we can work out that Olivia Peters skated with Andrew Scott, Elizabeth Smith skated with Samuel Peters, and that Anna Sparrow skated with David Smith.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  The pairs are:
</p>
<br>
  Lucy Scott and James Sparrow.

<br>
  Olivia Peters and Andrew Scott

<br>
  Elizabeth Smith and Samuel Peters

<br>
  Anna Sparrow and David Smith
