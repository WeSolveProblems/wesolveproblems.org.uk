<h1>Problem ID 88044</h1>
<p>
Four friends came to an ice-rink, each with her brother. They broke up into pairs and started skating. It turned out that in each pair the "gentleman" was taller than the "lady" and no one is skating with his sister. The tallest boy in the group was Yura Vorobyov, Andrei Egorov, then Luisa Egorov, Sergei Petrov, Olya Petrov, Dima Krymov, Inna Krymov and Anya Vorobyov. Determine who skated with whom.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Who did Luisa Yegorov skate with $($who is the tallest girl$)$?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The tallest of the girls is Luisa Yegorov, and by condition she skates with the boy who is taller than her. There are two such boys, but one of them is her brother. So, Luisa Yegorov skates with Yura Vorobyov. Similarly, we establish that Olya Petrov skates with Andrei Egorov, Inna Krymov - with Sergei Petrov, and Anya Vorobyov - with Dima Krymov.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Lusia Yegorov and Yura Vorobyov, Olya Petrov and Andrei Egorov, Inna Krymov and Sergei Petrov, Anya Vorobyov and Dima Krymov.
