<h1>Problem ID 88137</h1>
<p>
A kindergarten used cards for teaching children how to read: on some, the letter "MA" are written, on the rest - "DA". Each child took three cards and began to compose words from them. It turned out that the word "MAMA" was created from the cards by 20 children, the word "DADA" by 30 children, and the word "MADA" by 40 children. How many children all had 3 of the same cards?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Note that each child has three cards, and there are two different inscriptions on them.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Since each child has three cards and there are only two inscriptions, then two inscriptions must coincide, that is, one can combine either the word MAMA $($ of which there are 20 children $)$ or the word DADA $($ of which there are 30 children $)$. Hence, there are 50 children in all. If a child has all three cards the same, then they cannot create the word MADA $($ and there were 40 of such a word $)$. So, there are 50 - 40 = 10 children with three identical cards. 
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
10 children.
