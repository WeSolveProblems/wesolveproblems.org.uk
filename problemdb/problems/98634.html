<h1>Problem ID 98634</h1>
<p>
  100 cars are parked along the right hand side of a road. Among them there are 30 red, 20 yellow, and 20 pink Mercedes. It is known that no two Mercedes of different colours are parked next to one another. Prove that there must be three Mercedes cars parked next to one another of the same colour somewhere along the road.

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  We have 70 Mercedes cars and 30 'other' cars. We are given that next to a given Mercedes car there can either be another Mercedes car of the same colour, or an 'other' car. The more Mercedes cars are parked in pairs the fewer 'other' cars we need. But there are 35 pairs of Mercedes cars, so to wrap them we need at least 33 'other' cars. If the Mercedes cars are not all parked in pairs then we would need even more 'other' cars. But we are given that there are only 30 'other' cars, meaning we can only have at most 32 pairs of cars. Therefore there must be a group of 3 Mercedes cars of the same colour somewhere along the road.
