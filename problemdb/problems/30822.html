<h1>Problem ID 30822</h1> <p>
Prove that on the edges of a connected graph one can arrange arrows so that from some vertex one can reach any other vertex along the arrows. 

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Let us fix vertex A. First consider the vertices connected with A, then, the new vertices connected with them and so on. In this case, the edges connecting the added vertices with those already considered are oriented in the direction of the new vertices.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
