<h1>Problem ID 89911</h1>
<p>
 The tower clock chimes three times in 12 seconds. How long will six chimes last?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
What is the interval between two consecutive chimes?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Since 3 chimes of the clock occur in 12 seconds, the interval between two consecutive strokes is 6 seconds. From the first chime to the second - 6 seconds and from the second to the third - also 6 seconds. Six chimes are distributed with 5 intervals. Consequently, 6 chimes of the clock will strike for $5 \time 6$ = 30 seconds.
