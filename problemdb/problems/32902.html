<h1>Problem ID 32902</h1>
<p>
How many times greater is the sum of the numbers in the hundred and first line of the Pascal triangle than the sum of the numbers in the hundredth line?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Solution 1
<p>
Suppose that in the 100th line there are numbers $c_0, c_1, ..., c_{100|$. Then in the 101st row there are the numbers $c_0, c_0 + c_1, c_1 + c_2, ..., c_{99} + c_{100}, c_{100}$; and their sum is $2c_0 + 2c_1 + ... + 2c_{100}$.
<p>
Solution 2
<p>
The sum of the numbers in the string is equal to the number of paths leading from the vertex O of the Pascal triangle to the "points" of this line $($see problem number 30710$)$. But from each point of the 100th line, two paths lead to the points of the 101st line. Therefore, the total number of paths is doubled.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Two times greater.
