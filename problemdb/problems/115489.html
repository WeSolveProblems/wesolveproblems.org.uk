<h1>Problem ID 115489</h1>
<p>
One day, Claudia, Sofia and Freia noticed that they brought the same toy cars to kindergarten. Claudia has a car with a trailer, a small car and a green car without a trailer. Sofia has a car without a trailer and a small green one with a trailer, and Freia has a big car and a small blue car with a trailer. What kind of car $($in terms of colour, size and availability of a trailer$)$ did all of the girls bring to the kindergarten? Explain the answer.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If Freia had brought a blue small car with a trailer, then Sofia was supposed to bring a car with a trailer, but Sofia’s one is green. So, Freia brought a big car, and Sofia’s one was not small, that is, the car without a trailer. Then Claudia could not have brought a car with a trailer, and could not have brought a small car either. So, Claudia had to have brought a green car without a trailer. Thus, each of the girls brought a large green car without a trailer.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
A large green car without a trailer.
