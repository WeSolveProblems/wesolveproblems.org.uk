<h1>Problem ID 88065</h1>
<p>
One day a strange notebook was found on the stairs. It contained one hundred statements:
<p>
        "There is exactly one incorrect statement in this notebook";
        <p>
        "There are exactly two incorrect statements in this notebook";
        <p>
        "There are exactly three incorrect statements in this notebook";
        <p>
         ...
         <p>
        "There are exactly one hundred incorrect statements in this notebook."
        <p>
Are any of these statements true, and if so, which ones?


<h1>Hint</h1>
Note that the notebook contains one hundred statements, every two of which contradict each other.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The fact that 100 statements are recorded in the notebook, every two of which contradict each other, means that if there are true statements among them, then there cannot be more than one of them. Let's see if there can be at least one true statement. If exactly one statement is true, then exactly ninety-nine are wrong. And such a statement in the notebook is: "There are exactly ninety-nine incorrect statements in this notebook." So, in the notebook exactly one statement is true.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
Answer
There is one true statement: "There are exactly ninety-nine incorrect statements in this notebook."
