<h1>Problem ID 32995</h1> <p>
There are 57 villages in Leightonborough, between which there are some roads. It is known that from every village you can get to any other, but only via a single route.
<p>
a)	Prove that there is a village from which only one road emerges.
<p>
   b) How many roads are in Leightonborough?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
See problem number 31098 parts c) and b). It says the following:
<p>
b)	A tree has a pendant vertex $($see problem number 30786$)$. We delete it along with the edge that emerges from it. The remaining graph is also a tree. Therefore, it has a pendant vertex, which we also remove along with the edge that emerges from it. Having done this operation n - 1 times, we get a graph consisting of one vertex $($in which, of course, there are no edges$)$. Since each time exactly one edge was removed, there n -1 of them at first n - 1.
<p>
   c) Leave the hanging vertex and go to the graph as in problem number 30786. Just as there, this way will end in another hanging vertex.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
b) 56 roads.
