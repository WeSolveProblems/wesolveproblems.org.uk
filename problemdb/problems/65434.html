<h1>Problem ID 65434</h1>
<p>
It is known that AA + A = XYZ. What is the last digit of the product: $B \times C \times D \times D \times C \times E \times F \times G$ where different letters denote different numbers, identical letters denote identical numbers?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since a single-digit number A was added to a two-digit number AA and the result produced a three-digit number, then A = 9, and XYZ = 108. Note that 4 numbers have already been used. 6 other digits are used in the product $B \times C \times D \times D \times C \times E \times F \times G$. Therefore, among these numbers 2 and 5 can definitely be found, which means that this product ends in 0.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
The last digit is 0.
