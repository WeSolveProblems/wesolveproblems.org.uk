<h1>Problem</h1>
There are 101 buttons of 11 different colours. Prove that amongst them there are either 11 buttons of the same colour, or 11 buttons of different colours.
<h1>Hint</h1>
Imagine that there aren't 11 buttons of different colours. Then each button has one of 10 different colours.

<h1>Solution</h1>
Consider the case where there aren't 11 buttons of different colours. Then each button has one of 10 different colours. If there were no more than 10 buttons of the same colour, then there could be at most 100 buttons, which is a contradiction - hence there must be 11 buttons of the same colour for this to work. Note that the statement in the question becomes false if there are only 100 buttons.
