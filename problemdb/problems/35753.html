<h1>Problem ID 35753</h1>
<p>
  A convex polygon on a plane contains no fewer than $m^2+1$ points with whole number co-ordinates. Prove that within the polygon there are $m+1$ points with whole number co-ordinates that lie on a single straight line.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Colour in the points in the plane in $m^2$ different colours. There will be two points of the same colour.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  By the pigeon hole principle, within $m^2+1$ points with whole-number co-ordinates there will be two points $(k, l)$ and $k_1, l_1$ such that $k=k_1$ and $l=l_1$ - mod $m$.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore there will be $m+1$ points $ \left ( k+ \frac{k_1-k}{m}i , l+ \frac{l_1-l}{m}i \right ) , 0 \leq i \leq m, $ that have whole number co-ordinates and lie on the line segment connecting  $(k, l)$ and $k_1, l_1$.
</p>
