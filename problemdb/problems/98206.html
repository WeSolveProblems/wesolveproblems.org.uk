<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  An after school club was attended by 60 pupils. It turns out that in any 10 of them, there will always be 3 classmates. Prove that within the group of 60 who attended, there will always be at least 15 pupils from the same class.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Divide the 60 pupils into groups of classmates. There will be no more than 9 such groups (classes) as otherwise we could break the condition given by taking one pupil from each group. The fifth group by size from largest to smallest (if it exists) can contain no more than one pupil, otherwise by taking two pupils from 5 groups we could again break the condition given. Therefore the largest group must contain no less than $ (60-5) \div 4 = 15$ pupils.
