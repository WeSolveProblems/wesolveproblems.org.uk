<h1>Problem ID 61022</h1>
<p>
For which A and B does the polynomial $Ax^{n + 1} + Bx^n + 1$ have the number x = 1 at least two times as its root?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
$f (1) = A + B + 1, f '(1) = (n + 1) A + nB$. Solving the system: $A + B + 1 = (n + 1) A + nB = 0$, we find $A = n, B = - (n + 1)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
$A = n, B = - (n + 1)$.
