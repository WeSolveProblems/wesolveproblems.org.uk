<h1>Problem ID 66026</h1>
<p>
Gary drew an empty table of $50 \times 50$ and wrote on top of each column and to the left of each row a number. It turned out that all 100 written numbers are different, and 50 of them are rational, and the remaining 50 are irrational. Then, in each cell of the table, he wrote down a product of numbers written at the top of its column and to the left of the row $($ the "multiplication table" $)$. What is the largest number of products in this table which could be rational numbers?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Evaluation. Suppose that among the rational numbers there is a 0 and it is written on the top row of the table. Suppose that x irrational and 50 - x rational numbers are written along the left side of the table. Then along the upper side there are written 50 - x irrational and x rational numbers. We note that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational. Hence, in the table there are at least x $(x - 1)$ + $(50 - x)^2$ = $2x^2$ - 101x + $50^2$ irrational numbers. The parabola's vertex y = $2x^2 - 101x + 50^2$ is at the point 25,25, therefore the minimum value of this function at an integer point is reached at x = 25 and is equal to $25 \times 24 + 25^2 = 1225$.
If 0 is replaced by a non-zero rational number, then the number of irrational numbers can only increase. Therefore in the table in any case there are no more than 2500 - 1225 = 1275 rational numbers.
<p>
Example, when the rational number is 1275. Along the left side, we put the numbers 1, 2, ..., 24, 25, $\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2}, ..., 25 \sqrt{2}$, and along the upper side we place the numbers 0, 26, 27, ..., 49, 26\sqrt{2}, 27\sqrt{2}, ..., 50 \sqrt{2}$. Then only $25 \times 24$ + $25^2$ will be irrational = 1225 products of nonzero rational and irrational numbers.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
1275 products.
