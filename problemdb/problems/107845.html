<h1>Problem ID 107845</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to find natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ which satisfy the equation $28x+30y+31z=365$?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In a year there are 12 months. One of these (February) has 28 days. Four months (April, June, September, November) have 30 days and the rest of the months have 31 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, so we have: $28\times 1 + 30\times 4 + 31\times 7 = 365$.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes such $x$, $y$ and $z$ can be found.

</p>

<h1>Remark</h1>
<p>
There is also another solution: $x=2$, $y=1$, $z=9$.
