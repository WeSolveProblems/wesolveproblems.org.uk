<h1>Problem ID 86091</h1>
<p>
In the numbers of MEXAILO and LOMONOSOV, each letter denotes a number $($different letters correspond to different numbers$)$. It is known that the products of the numbers of these two words are equal. Can both numbers be odd?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Note that 10 different letters are used, therefore each digit is indicated by a letter, in particular, among these numbers there is zero. Thus, the product of the digits of one number $($and hence of the second$)$ is zero. Consequently, both of these numbers have a zero. In the words of MEXAILO and LOMONOSOV, the common letters are M, L and O, therefore zero is denoted by one of them. This cannot be L and M, since the numbers cannot start with a zero. Hence, zero is denoted by the letter O. In the number of MEXAILO the zero is at the end, that is, this number is even.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
No.
