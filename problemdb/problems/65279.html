<h1>Problem ID 65279</h1>
<p>
The probability that a purchased lightbulb will work is 0.95. How many light bulbs should I buy so that, with a probability of 0.99, there would be at least 5 that work among them?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
We take 6 bulbs. The probability that among them there will be at least 5 that work, is the sum of the probabilities that among them there will be exactly 5 that work and exactly 6 that work, that is $6 \times 0.95^5 \times 0.05$ + $0.95^6$ = 0.9672. Now we try taking 7 bulbs. The required probability is $21 \times 0.95^5 \times 0.05^2$ + $7 \times 0.95^6 \times 0.05$ + $0.95^7$ = 0.9962.
</p> 

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
7 light bulbs.
