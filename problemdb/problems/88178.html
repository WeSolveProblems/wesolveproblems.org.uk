<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  Is it always the case that in any 25 GBP banknotes - that is £5, £10, £20, and £50 notes - there will always be 7 banknotes of the same denomination?
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Think about how many banknotes there will be if there are no more than 6 banknotes of each of the 4 denominations.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Yes. If there were no more than 6 banknotes of each of the 4 denominations, the maximimum number of banknotes would be 24. However there are 25, so there must be at least one denomination of which there are 7 banknotes.
