<h1>Problem ID 102796</h1>
<p>
Inside a square with side 1 there are several circles, the sum of the radii of which is 0.51. Prove that there is a line that is parallel to one side of the square and that intersects at least 2 circles.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Letâ€™s place these circles on one side of the square. The projection of one circle is a segment whose length is equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the projection of the circles on the side is equal to $2 \times 0.51$ = 1.02, which is greater than the side of the square. Hence, the projection of the two circles has a common point. The perpendicular line to the side of the square, reconstructed at this point, is the desired point, since it will cross the corresponding two circles.
