<h1>Problem ID 65155</h1>
<p>
  A carpet has a square shape with side 275cm. A moth has eaten 4 holes through it. Will it always be possible to cut a square section of side 1m out of the carpet, so that the section does not contain any holes? Treat the holes as points.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  On the carpet it is possible to mark 5 non-overlapping squares of side 1m - see the diagram below, the dashed square is of side $0.75 \sqrt{2} >1$. At least one of these will be left without a hole in it.
