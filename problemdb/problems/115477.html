<h1>Problem ID 115477</h1>
<p>
In the king’s prison, there are five cells numbered from 1 to 5. In each cell, there is one prisoner. Kristen persuaded the king to conduct an experiment: on the wall of each cell she writes at one point a number and at midnight, each prisoner will go to the cell with the indicated number $($if the number on the wall coincides with the cell number, the prisoner does not go anywhere$)$. On the following night at midnight, the prisoners again must move from their cell to another cell according to the instructions on the wall, and they do this for five nights. If the location of prisoners in the cells for all six days $($including the first$)$ is never repeated, then Kristen will be given the title of Wisdom, and the prisoners will be released. Help Kristen write numbers in the cells.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let Kristen record the specified set of numbers on the walls of the cells. Then the first two prisoners will change places every night, that is, each of them will return to their original place every two days. The remaining three prisoners will return to their places once every three days. Since the numbers 2 and 3 are mutually prime, we get six different locations of prisoners in the cells.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
For example: 2, 1, 4, 5, 3 $($in the order of the cell numbers$)$.
