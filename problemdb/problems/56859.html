<h1>Problem ID 56859</h1>
<p>
A circle divides each side of a triangle into three equal parts. Prove that this triangle is regular.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let A and B, C and D, E and F be the points of intersection of the circle with the sides PQ, QR, RP of the triangle PQR. Consider the median PS. It connects the centers of the parallel chords FA and DC and is therefore perpendicular to them. Therefore, PS is the height of the triangle PQR, and hence PQ = PR. Similarly, PQ = QR.
