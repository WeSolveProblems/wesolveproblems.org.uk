<h1>Problem ID 30708</h1>
<p>
A person has 10 friends and within a few days invites some of them to visit so that his guests never repeat $($on some of the days he may not invite anyone$)$. How many days can he do this for?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first way. For each of the 10 friends there are two possibilities: you can invite or not invite him or her. So, there are $2^10$ possible ways of choosing a group of friends.
<p>
The second way. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of subsets of a set of 10 elements. As you know, there are $2^10$ of them.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
1024 days.
