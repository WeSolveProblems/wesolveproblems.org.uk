<h1>Problem ID 35632</h1>
<p>
A raisin bag contains 2001 raisins with a total weight of 1001 g, and no raisin weighs more than 1.002 g.
Prove that all the raisins can be divided onto two scales so that they show a difference in weight not exceeding 1 g.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Collect all the heaviest raisins on one bowl until the bowl weighs more than 500 grams.

</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Take 500 of the heaviest raisins and put them on the left side of the scales. The weight of these 500 raisins is not greater than $500 \times 1.002$ = 501 g. We consider two cases.
<p>
1$)$ The lightest of these raisins weighs more than 1 g. Then the total weight of the raisins on the left bowl will be more than 500 g. Put the remaining raisins on the right side of the scales. Their total weight is no less than 1001 - 501 = 500 g, but not more than the weight of raisins on the left bowl. Hence, the difference between the weights on the two bowls will not be greater than 1 g.2$)$ The lightest of these raisins weighs no more than 1 g. Then, if necessary, we will put raisins on the left bowl one by one until its weight becomes greater than 500 g. Since we chose raisins weighing no more than 1 g, the total weight the raisins on the left cup will not be greater than 501 g. Put the remaining raisins on the right bowl, and just as in the first case, we get that the difference between the weights of the bowls will not exceed 1 g.
