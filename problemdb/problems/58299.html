<h1>Problem ID 58299</h1>
<p>
Suppose that n $ \geq $ 3. Are there n points that do not lie on one line, whose pairwise distances are irrational, and the areas of all of the triangles with vertices in them are rational?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Yes, there are. Consider the points $P_i = (i, i^2)$, where i = 1, ..., n. The areas of all of the triangles with vertices at the nodes of the integer lattice are rational $($see problem 24.5$)$, and the numbers $P_iP_j = | i - j | \sqrt {1+ (i + j)^2} $ are irrational.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, there are.
