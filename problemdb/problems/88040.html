<h1>Problem ID 88040</h1>
<p>
Decipher the following rebus
<p>
<img src="88040.png"><p>



All the digits indicated by the letter "E" are even $($ not necessarily equal $)$; all the numbers indicated by the letter O are odd $($ also not necessarily equal $)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
For the convenience of further reasoning, we replace all even numbers with vowels, and odd ones with consonants, bearing in mind that the same number can correspond to different letters. Therefore the rebus will take the following form:
<p>

Note that the numbers AEB and YHK differ by the second digit, so C $>$ 1. For C $>$ 3 or A $>$ 2, the product $AEB \times C$ will be four-digit, therefore C = 3, A = 2. Hence, I is at most 2, that is it is equal to 2. It follows that D = 9 $($ for a smaller value of D, the expression $AEB \times D$ will be less than 2100, and IFUG $>$ 2100 $)$
Y = 8 $($ otherwise the entire product will not be a five-digit number $)$. E = 8 $($ if E $<$ 8, then YHK $<$ 810 $)$. If B varies from 1 to 9, then the number represented by IFUG will vary from 2529 to 2601, therefore F = 5, and B $<$ 9. H = 5 $($ with B changing from 1 to 7, YHK will vary from 843 to 861 $)$. K = 5 $($ otherwise the number 85K will not be divisible by 3 $)$.

285 Ã— 39 = 11115.
