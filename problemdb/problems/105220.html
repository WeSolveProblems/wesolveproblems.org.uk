<h1>Problem ID 105220</h1>
<p>
All of the sweets of different sorts in stock are arranged in n boxes, for which prices are set at 1, 2, ..., n, respectively. It is required to buy such k of these boxes of the least total value, which contain at least k/n of the mass of all of the sweets. It is known that the mass of sweets in each box does not exceed the mass of sweets in any more expensive box.
<p>
a)	What boxes should I buy when n = 10 and k = 3?
<p>
  b) The same question for arbitrary natural numbers n ≥ k.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
   Let $a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n$ be the mass of the sweets in the boxes costing 1, 2, ..., n, respectively, and $n_1 $<$ n_2 $<$... $<$ n_k$ be the numbers of those boxes that need to be purchased.
<p>
1.	We denote $m_j = jn / k (j = 1, ..., k)$ and prove that the required set of numbers must satisfy the inequalities $n_j ≥ m_j. (*)$
<p>
   Indeed, suppose that $n_j $<$m_j$ for some j.
<p>
   Then, for example, in the case $a_1$ = ... = $a_{n_j}$ = $n_j$ $<$ $a_{n_j + 1}$ = ... = $a_n$ = $n + n_j$
we get
<p>
      $a_1 + ... + a_n = n_j^2 + (n-n_j) (n + n_j) = n_2$,
<p>
      $an_1 + ... + an_k = (k - j) (n + n_j) + jn_j <(k - j) n + nj = kn$,
<p>
that is, the requirement of the task is violated.
<p>
2.	Suppose now that all of the inequalities $(*)$ are true. Let us prove that the requirement of the problem is satisfied.
<p>
   a) For n = 10, k = 3, we have $n_1 ≥ 10/3, n_2 ≥ 20/3, n_1 ≥ 10$, i.e. it is enough to take the 4th, 7th and 10th boxes. And really:

<p>
$($adding to the group of numbers a number less than all of them, we reduce the arithmetic mean$)$.
<p>
b)	Let’s set $n_0 = m_0 = a_0 = 0$ and take the integers $n_j = m_j + ε_j$, where 0 ≤ ε $<$1. Consider the step function given by the equalities $f (x) = a_j$ for j - 1 $<$x ≤ j. Since the function does not decrease, its average value on the gap decreases when both ends of the gap are shifted to the left $($even with a change in the length of the gap$)$. $($The average value is the area under the graph of the function at a given interval, divided by the length of this interval$)$. In particular,

<p>
   therefore
      <p>
<img src="105220 3.gif">
<p>
since all denominators are equal to n/k, $n_k = m_k = n, ε_k = 0$.
<p>
   Thus, the cost of a set of k boxes satisfying the requirement of the problem will be the smallest for the smallest integers $n_j$ satisfying the inequalities $(*)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Boxes costing a) 4, 7 and 10 respectively. b) <img src="105220 4.gif">


</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
   The task goes back to the television game "One Hundred To One", where in the final stage two players are asked on 5 questions. For each of them, the most popular answers $($according to the results of the survey$)$ are prepared, the total cost of which is 100 points. Neither these answers themselves, nor especially their values, corresponding to their popularity, are not known to the players.
<p>
   If the players, for all questions, give a pair of the most popular answer from 5, then earn for each question at least 100 · 2/5 = 40 points, and for all 5 questions - at least 200 points, which is just required to score for the win, that is, the game, in general, is honest.
   Proceeding from the solution of the problem, it can be argued that with any distribution of scores on the answers, players are allowed to make a little mistake: they obviously will not lose, if for each question paired with the most popular answer they do not guess the next most popular answer but the one with average popularity.
