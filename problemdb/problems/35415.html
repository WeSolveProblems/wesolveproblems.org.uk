<h1>Problem ID 35415</h1>
<p>
  10 natural numbers are written on a blackboard. Prove that it is always possible to choose some of these numbers and write "$+$" or "$-$" between them so that the resulting algebraic sum is divisible by 1001.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  First consider summations using only the "$+$" symbol. Then show that it is possible to subtract one of these summations from the other, so that the result is divisible by 1001.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider all of the possible summations of some of the given numbers. The number of such possible summations is equal to $2^1^0=1024$; we include the 'empty' summation. By the pigeon hole principle two of these summations $S_1 and S_2$ must have the same remainder when divided by 1001. The difference between these summations $S_1-S_2$ is divisible by 1001 and represents a summation consisting of some of the given numbers with the signs "$+$" and "$-$" between them.
