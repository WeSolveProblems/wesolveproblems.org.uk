<h1>Problem ID 64819</h1>
<p>
Authors: B.R. Frenkin, T.V. Kazitcina <p>

On the tree sat 100 parrots of three kinds: green, yellow, multi-coloured. A crow flew past and croaked: "Among you, there are more green parrots than multi-coloured ones!" - "Yes!" - agreed 50 parrots, and the others shouted "No!". Glad to the dialogue, the crow again croaked: "Among you, there are more multi-coloured parrots than yellow ones!" Again, half of the parrots shouted "Yes!", and the rest - "No!". The green parrots both told the truth, the yellow ones lied both times, and each of the multi-coloured ones lied once, and once told the truth. Could there be more yellow than green parrots? 

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Both times the truth was told by 50 parrots - all of the green ones and some multi-cloured ones. Therefore, the first time the truth was told as many multi-coloured parrots as in the second times. So, the first time the multi-coloured parrots told the truth and lied equally. And since the first time, the truth and lies were told by the same number of parrots, the yellow and green parrots were equally divided.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
No, it cannot be.
</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
The solution does not use what questions the crow asked, it is only important that both times "yes" and "no" was answered by an equal number of parrots.
