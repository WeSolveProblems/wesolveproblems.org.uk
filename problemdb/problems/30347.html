<h1>Problem ID 30347</h1>
<p>
The Russian Chess Championship is made up of one round. How many games are played if 18 chess players participate?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first way. Each participant must play 17 games, in each game two people play. Therefore, there are $18 \times 17$ /2 = 153 games in total.
<p>
The second way. In each game one point is up for grabs. Suppose that all games end in a draw. Then each participant will gain 17/2 = 8.5 points. Thus, the total number of points, and hence the total number of games is $18 \times 8.5$ = 153.
<p>
The third way. The number of games is equal to the number of pairs of participants, that is <img src="30347.gif">
