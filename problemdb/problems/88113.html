<h1>Hint</h1>
Try turning over the first three coins.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
It can be done, and pretty quickly. We will turn over the first three coins. Then the first two coins will show heads, and the last three will show tails. Now we turn over the last three coins, and all five coins will show heads.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
Yes: in the first turn, we turn over the first 3 coins, the second - the last 3 coins.
