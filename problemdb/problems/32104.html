<h1>Problem ID 32104</h1>
<p>
 One of five brothers baked a cake for their Mum. Alex said: "This was Vernon or Tom." Vernon said: "It was not I and not Will who did it." Tom said: "You're both lying." David said: "No, one of them told the truth, and the other was lying." Will said: "No David, you're wrong." Mum knows that three of her sons always tell the truth. Who made the cake?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We consider separately three possible cases.
<p>
1$)$ Alex and Vernon both lie. This means that Tom is telling the truth, David is lying and Will is telling the truth.
<p>
2$)$ One of the guys $($Alex or Vernon$)$ is telling the truth, and the second is lying. In this case, Tom is lying, David is telling the truth and Will is lying.
<p>
3$)$ Alex and Vernon both speak the truth. Then Tom and David lie, Will tells the truth.
Only in the third case is the truth spoken by three of the brothers. So, only this case could have taken place. As Alex tells the truth, the cake was baked either by Vernon or Tom. However, Vernon $($and he, as we found out, also tells the truth$)$ denies that he did it. So, Tom baked the cake. At the same time, Alex, Vernon and Will told the truth.
