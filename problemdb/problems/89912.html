<h1>Problem ID 89912</h1>
Fred always tells the truth, but Vadim always lies. What question should they be asked, so that they would give the same answers?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Try to find a question related to such a characteristic that is true for one boys, and is incorrect for the other.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The question should relate to such a characteristic that is true for one boys, and is incorrect for the other. There are two such characteristics: name and honesty. Therefore, there can be two questions: "Do you always tell the truth?" or "Is you name Fred?". Any of these questions can be made more complicated indefinitely, for example, "Does your friend always speak the truth?", or "Is your friend's name Fred?" etc.
