<h1>Problem ID 64957</h1>
<p>
  Each day, from Monday to Friday, an old man went to the sea and threw in a net to catch fish. On each day the man caught no more fish than on the previous day. In total over the 5 days the man caught exactly 100 fish. What is the minimum total number of fish the man could have caught on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  On Tuesday and Friday the old man cannot have caught more fish than on Monday and Wednesday respectively. Therefore, over the three days given, he cannot have caught less than half the total, that is less than 50 fish.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if on each of the first four days the man caught 25 fish and then caught none on Friday the condition of the problem is fulfilled, but in the given three days the man caught exactly 50 fish.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  50 fish.
