<h1>Problem ID 31083</h1>
<p>
A class has more than 32, but less than 40 people. Every boy is friends with three girls, and every girl is friends with five boys. How many people are there in the class?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The number of edges in the corresponding graph is three times the number of boys and five times the number of girls. Consequently, the number of girls refers to the number of boys in the ratio 3:5, and the total number of pupils is divisible by 8. But between 32 and 40 such numbers do not exist.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	There is no such class.
