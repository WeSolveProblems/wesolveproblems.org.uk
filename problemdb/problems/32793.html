<h1>Problem ID 32793</h1>
<p>
In a certain realm there are magicians, sorcerers and wizards. The following is known about them: firstly, not all magicians are sorcerers, and secondly, if the wizard is not a sorcerer, then he is not a magician. Is it true that not all magicians are wizards?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
First, we reformulate the conditions of the problem a little. So, we know two statements:
<p>
1)	At least one magician is not a sorcerer;
<p>
2)	If the magician is also a wizard, he is also a sorcerer.
<p>
Let's look now at any magician who is not a sorcerer $($this exists from the 1st condition$)$. If he was also a wizard, then under the second condition he would have been a sorcerer, but he is not a sorcerer, so he is not a wizard either. Therefore, not all magicians are wizards.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, it is true.
