<h1>Problem</h1>
26 numbers are chosen from the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 49, 50$. Will there always be two numbers chosen, whose difference is 1?
<h1>Hint</h1>
Divide all the numbers into pairs of adjacent numbers.

<h1>Solution</h1>
Let us divide all of the numbers into 25 adjacent pairs $1-2, 3-4, ..., 49-50$ If in each pair no more than one number was chosen, there would be no more than 25 numbers chosen in total. However the question states that 26 numbers are chosen. This means, for one of the pairs, both of the numbers in the pair are chosen. This pair therefore constitutes the pair of numbers chosen whose difference is 1.

<h1>Answer</h1>
Yes.
