<h1>Problem ID 87957</h1>
<p>
The best student in the class, Katie, and the second-best, Mike, tried to find the minimum 5-digit number which consists of different even numbers. Katie found her number correctly, but Mike was mistaken. However, it turned out that the difference between Katie and Mike’s numbers was less than 100. What are Katie and Mike’s numbers?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think about what should be the first two digits of Katie’s number and the last two digits of Mike’s number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If you act in the same way as in the previous problem, Katie’s number would be 02468, but the first digit cannot be zero, so Katie’s number would be 20468. Let's try to find Mike’s number. It is larger than Katie’s number, but it consists of the same numbers. The first three digits cannot be changed, because then the difference between Mike and Katie’s numbers would be more than 100. Note that you can only replace the 4th digit, and you can change it only to the fifth, otherwise the difference will be more than 100. So, Mike’s number is 20486.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
20486.
