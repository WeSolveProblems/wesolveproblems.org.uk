<h1>Problem ID 56573</h1>
<p>
From the point M, moving along a circle, the perpendiculars MP and MQ are dropped onto the diameters AB and CD. Prove that the length of the segment PQ does not depend on the position of the point M.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We denote the center of the circle by O. The points P and Q lie on a circle of diameter OM, that is, the points O, P, Q and M lie on a circle of constant radius of R / 2. In this case, either $\angle$POQ = $\angle$AOD, or $\angle$POQ = $\angle$BOD = 180$^{\circ}$ - $\angle$AOD, that is, the length of the chord PQ is constant.
