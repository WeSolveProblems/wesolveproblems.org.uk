<h1>Problem ID 79322</h1>
<p>
  A spherical sun is observed to have a finite number of circular sunspots, each of which covers less than half of the sun's surface. These sunspots are said to be enclosed, that is no two sunspots can touch, and they do not overlap with one another. Prove that the sun will have two diametrically opposite points that are not covered by sunspots.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider the sunspot with the largest radius. Consider a circle with the same centre, with a slightly larger radius than this sunspot, that still takes up less than half the sun's surface and does not overlap with any other sunspot. Such a circle must exist since no two sunspots can touch, so there must be a gap between the largest sunspot and any other.
</p>
<p>
  If we consider the area not enclosed by the sunspot, but enclosed by our larger circle, we get a 'ribbon' around the spherical sun where no point is covered by a sunspot.
</p>
<p>
  Now think about all of the diametrically opposite points of those inside the 'ribbon', i.e. from each point in the ribbon draw a line through the centre of the sphere - sun - and mark the point where this line exits the sphere on the other side. This gives us a second 'ribbon', let this be the 'reflected ribbon'.
</p>
<p>
  This reflected ribbon cannot be completely covered by sunspots. It cannot be covered by a single sunspot as such a sunspot would need to have a larger radius than the enlarged circle we used to create the original ribbon. If it did then it would be the largest sunspot, and not the one we initially started with, so this would be a contradiction.
</p>
<p>
  Equally the 'reflected ribbon' cannot be completely covered by multiple sunspots, since there is a finite number of sunspots that do not overlap and there must be some gap between any two adjacent sunspots.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore there must be at least one point on the reflected ribbon not covered by a sunspot. This point, along with its diametrically opposite point which lies on the original ribbon and so cannot be covered by a sunspot, gives us the two searched for points.
