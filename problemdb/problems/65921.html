<h1>Problem ID 65921</h1>
<p>
The function f $($x$)$ is defined for all real numbers, and for any x the equalities f $($x + 2$)$ = f $($2 - x$)$ and f $($x + 7$)$ = f $($7 - x$)$ are satisfied.
Prove that f $($x$)$ is a periodic function.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Let us prove that this function has a period of 10. We can argue this in different ways.
<p>
The first method. f $($x + 10$)$ = f $($$($x + 3$)$ + 7$)$ = f $($4 - x$)$ = f $($$($2 - x$)$ + 2$)$ = f $($x$)$.
<p>
The second method. The first equation means that the points with coordinates $($x + 2, f $($x + 2$)$$)$ and $($2 - x, f $($2 - x$)$$)$ are symmetric with respect to the straight line x = 2, that is, this line is the axis of symmetry of the graph y = f $($x$)$. Similarly, from the second equality it follows that the line x = 7 is also the axis of symmetry of this graph.
The composition of the two symmetries with parallel axes is a parallel translation by 10 to the right. Thus, the graph of our function goes into itself with a shift of 10 to the right. This means that it is periodic with a period of 10.
