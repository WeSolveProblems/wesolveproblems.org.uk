<h1>Problem ID 88103</h1>
<p>
In a room, there are 85 red and blue balloons. It is known that: 1) at least one of the balloons is red; 2) from each arbitrarily chosen pair of balloons at least one blue. How many red balloons are there in the room?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Think about whether there can be two red balloons in the room.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Since there is blue balloon among any two balloons, there cannot be two red balloons in the room. So, there are 84 blue balloons and 1 red balloon in the room.
