<h1>Problem ID 65265</h1>
<p>
Peter proposes to Sam the opportunity to play the following game. Peter gives Sam two boxes of sweets. In each of the two boxes are chocolate sweets and caramels. In all, there are 25 candies in both boxes. Peter proposes that Sam takes a candy from each box. If both sweets turn out to be chocolate, then Sam wins. Otherwise, Peter wins. The probability that Sam will get two caramels is 0.54. Who has a greater chance of winning?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Since Sam will take out two caramels with a probability of 0.54, the probability that he will take out two chocolate candies, certainly does not exceed 1 - 0.54 = 0.46, that is, the probability of winning for Sam is less than Â½. Hence, there is a greater chance of victory for Peter.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Peter.
