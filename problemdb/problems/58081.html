<h1>Problem ID 58081</h1>
<p>
There are 5 points inside an equilateral triangle with side of length 1. Prove that the distance between some two of them is less than 0.5.

</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The middle lines of a right-angled triangle with sides of length 1 divide it into four regular triangles with a side of 0.5. Therefore, there are at least two points in one of the smaller triangles, and these points cannot be the vertices of the triangle. The distance between these points is less than 0.5.
