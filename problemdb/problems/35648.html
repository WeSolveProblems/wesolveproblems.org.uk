<h1>Problem ID 35648</h1>
<p>
Father Christmas has an infinite number of sweets. A minute before the New Year, Father Christmas gives some children 100 sweets, while the Snow Maiden takes one sweet from them. Within half a minute before the New Year, Father Christmas gives the children 100 more sweets, and the Snow Maiden again takes one sweet. The same is repeated for 15 seconds, for 7.5 seconds, etc. until the new Year. Prove that the Snow Maiden will be able to take away all the sweets from the children by the New Year.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Number the sweets. Let the first time the Snow Maiden took a candy, she took the sweet with the number 1, the second time - candy with number 2, etc.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We number the sweets with natural numbers 1, 2, ... so that the first time Father Christmas gives out sweets with numbers from 1 to 100, the second time - sweets with numbers from 101 to 200, etc. Let the first time the Snow Maiden took away a candy with number 1 from the children, a second time a candy with number 2, etc. Then for any n the candy with the number n will be with the Snow Maiden for 1 / 2n-1 minutes before the New Year.
