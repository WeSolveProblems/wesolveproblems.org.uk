<h1>Problem ID 110185</h1>
<p>
Five teams participated in a football tournament. Each team had to play exactly one match with each of the other teams. Due to financial difficulties, the organisers cancelled some of the games. As a result, it turned out that all teams scored a different number of points and no team scored zero points. What is the smallest number of games that could be played in the tournament, if three points were awarded for a victory, one for a draw and zero for a defeat?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In the tournament, at least 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 points are played for, and since for each game the teams in total scored no more than three points, then at least five games were played. But there could not be five games because then all of the games would have ended in one teamâ€™s victory, and there would not be a team that scored one point.
For six games this could happen: for example, teams A and B, B and E, D and E tied, and C, D, E won against A.

</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
6 games.
</p>
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>

8 points
