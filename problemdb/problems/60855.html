<h1>Problem ID 60855</h1>
<p>
One of the roots of the equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0 is 1 + \sqrt 3$. Find a and b if you know that they are rational.

</p> <h1>Solution 1</h1> <p> 
Substituting $x = 1 + \sqrt 3$ into the equation, we arrive at the equation $(4 + a + b) + (a + 2) \sqrt 3 = 0$. Since $\sqrt 3$ is an irrational number, this equality is possible only when 4 + a + b = 0 and a + 2 = 0.

</p> <h1>Solution 2</h1> <p> 
The second root of this equation is the conjugate number $1 - \sqrt 3$ $($see the solution of problem number 60624$)$. Therefore,
<p>
$- a = (1 + \sqrt 3) + (1 - \sqrt3 ) = 2$,
$b = (1 + \sqrt 3) (1 - \sqrt 3) = - 2$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
a = b = -2.
