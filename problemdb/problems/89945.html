<h1>Problem ID 89945</h1>
<p>
Along two linear park alleys are planted five oaks - three along each alley. Where should the sixth oak be planted so that it is possible to lay two more linear alleys, along each of which there would also be three oak trees growing?

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to start by drawing new alleys.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We have two pairs of trees that are not connected to both alleys. We draw two alleys passing around these two pairs $($this can be done in two ways - we choose any$)$. At the intersection of the new alleys, we plant a sixth tree.
