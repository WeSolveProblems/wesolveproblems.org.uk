<h1>Problem ID 61038</h1>
<p>
Let it be known that all the roots of some equation $x^3$ + $px^2$ + qx + r = 0 are positive. What additional condition must be satisfied by its coefficients p, q and r in order for it to be possible to form a triangle from segments whose lengths are equal to these roots?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Let u, v, w be the roots of our equation. The condition is equivalent to the inequality $($v + w - u$)$ $($u + w - v$)$ $($u + v - w$)$ $>$ 0. But
$($u + v - v$)$ $($u + v - w$)$ = $($-p-2u$)$ $($-p-2v$)$ $($-p-2w$)$ = -$p^3$ - 2 $($u + v + w$)$ $p^2$ - 4 $($uv + uw + vw$)$ p - 8uvw =
  = - $p^3$ + $2p^3$ - 4pq + 8r = $p^3$ - 4pq + 8r.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
$p^3$ - 4pq + 8r $>$ 0.
