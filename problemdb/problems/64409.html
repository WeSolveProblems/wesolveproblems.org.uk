<h1>Problem ID 64409</h1>
<p>
Prove that the polynomial P $(x)$ is divisible by its derivative if and only if P $(x)$ has the form P $(x)$ = $a_n$ $(x – x_0)^n$.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
If the polynomial has the indicated form, then the assertion is obvious.
Suppose that a polynomial P of degree n is divisible by P '. The quotient must have a power of 1, so it follows from the comparison of the primary coefficients that nP $(x)$ = $(x – x_0)$ P ' $(x)$.
Let $x_0$ be a root of multiplicity k, that is, P $(x)$ = $(x – x_0)^k$ Q $(x)$, where Q $(x_0)$ ≠ 0. Then
n $(x – x_0)^k$ Q$(x)$ = nP $(x)$ = $(x – x_0)$ P '$(x)$ = $(x – x_0)^{k + 1}$ Q' $(x)$ + k$(x – x_0)^k$ Q $(x)$ , that is, nQ $(x)$ = $(x – x_0)$ Q’ $(x)$ + kQ $(x)$, $(n - k)$ Q $(x)$ = $(x – x_0)$ Q' $(x)$. Since Q $(x_0)$ ≠ 0, it follows that k = n.
