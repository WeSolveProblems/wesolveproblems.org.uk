<h1>Problem ID 35344</h1>
<p>Prove that if $a, b, c$ are odd numbers, then at least one of the numbers $ab-1, bc-1, ca-1$ is divisible by 4.</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>Consider the remainders of the given numbers when divided by 4 and make use of the Pigeon Hole Principle.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Since the numbers $a, b, c$ are odd, when divided by 4 they can have remainders of 1 or 3. It follows that at least two of them will have the same remainder. Consider the case where $a, b$ have remainder 3 - the other cases can be considered in the same way. Then $ab-1 = (4k+3)(4n+3) -1 = 16kn + 12(k+n) +8$ which is divisible by 4.</p>
