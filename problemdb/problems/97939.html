<h1>Problem ID 97939</h1>
<p>
Two play a game on a chessboard 8 Ã— 8. The player who makes the first move puts a knight on the board. Then they take turns moving it $($ according to the usual rules $)$, whilst you can not put the knight on a cell which he already visited. The loser is one who has nowhere to go. Who wins with the right strategy - the first player or his partner?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We divide all the squares into 32 pairs so that the squares of one pair are connected by the course of the knight $($ Figure 1 $)$.

Wherever the first player puts his knight somewhere for his turn, the second player moves it to the cell in its pair. Therefore, the second player will always have a move to make, and he can not lose.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
His partner.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. 6 points.
<p>
2. For the general case, see the solutions of the Quanta Quiz $($ task M1048 $)$.
