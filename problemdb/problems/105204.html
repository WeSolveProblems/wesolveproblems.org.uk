<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  In a mathematical olympiad $m>1$ candidates solved $n>1$ problems. Each candidate solved a different number of problems to all the others. Each problem was solved by a different number of candidates to all the others. Prove that one of the candidates solved exactly one problem.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If there was a candidate, who did not solve a single problem, we will ignore them. If there was a problem that was not solved by a single candidate, we will ignore it. As before the candidates solved different numbers of problems, and the problems were solved by different numbers of candidates. Let there be $m'$ candidates and $n'$ problems remaining. Then $m' \geq 1, n' \geq 1$.
</p>
<p>
  If each of the $m'$ candidates solved between 2 and $n'$ problems, and all of the candidates solved different numbers of problems, then $ m' \leq n'-1$. Since each of the $n'$ problems was solved by between 1 and $m'$ pupils, and all of the problems were solved by different numbers of pupils $n' \leq m'$ This is a contradiction, therefore the required candidate (who solved exactly one problem) must exist.
