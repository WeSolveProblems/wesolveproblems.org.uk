<h1>Problem ID 32052</h1>
<p>
There were seven boxes. In some of them, seven more boxes were placed inside $($not nested in each other$)$, etc. As a result, there are 10 non-empty boxes.
How many boxes are there now in total?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
At each operation one empty box is filled. As there were 10 non-empty boxes, 10 operations were performed. Each operation added seven boxes. Therefore, as a result, the total number of boxes was 7 + $10 \times 7$ = 77.

2. In the book "Algebra and Number Theory" the problem is given in a more general form: 7 is replaced by k, and 10 by m.
