<h1>Problem ID 30449</h1>
<p>
There are twenty dots distributed along the circumference of circle. Consider the game with two players where: in one move a player is allowed to connect any two of the dots with a chord &#40;aline going through the inside of the circle&#41;, as long as the chord does not intersect those previously drawn. The loser is the one who cannot make a move. Which player wins?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first player wins. During their first turn, the first player draws a chord such that 9 dots are on one side of the chord, and 9 dots are on the other side of the chord. In the following turns, the first player answers each of the second player's moves with an anologous move but on the other side of the initial chord.
