<h1>Problem ID 116467</h1>
<p>
 Four people discussed the answer to a task.
<p>
Harry said: "This is the number 9".
<p>
Ben: "This is a prime number."
<p>
Katie: "This is an even number."
<p>
And Natasha said that this number is divisible by 15.
<p>
One boy and one girl answered correctly, and the other two made a mistake. What is the actual answer to the question?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
If Harry answered correctly, then both girls were mistaken, since the number 9 is odd and is not divisible by 15. Hence, Ben gave the correct answer.
But a prime number is not divisible by 15, and the only even prime number is 2.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
2.
