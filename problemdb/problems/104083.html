<h1>Problem ID 104083</h1>
<p>
 In a physics club, the teacher created the following experiment. He spread out 16 weights of weight 1, 2, 3, ..., 16 grams onto weighing scales, so that one of the bowls outweighed the other. Fifteen students in turn left the classroom and took with them one weight each, and after each student's departure, the scales changed their position and outweighed the opposite bowl of the scales. What weight could remain on the scales?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Since at each moment of time the masses on the scales differed by at least 1 gram, then in order to outweigh the opposite bowl, it is necessary to take a weight of at least two grams. Consequently, leaving the class, no student could take a weight of 1 gram.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
On the scales there was a weight of 1 gram.
