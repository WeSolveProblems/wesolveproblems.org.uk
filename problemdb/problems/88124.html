<h1>Problem ID 88124</h1>
<p>
The distance between Athos and Aramis, galloping along one road, is 20 leagues. In an hour Athos covers 4 leagues, and Aramis - 5 leagues.
What will the distance between them be in an hour?
<p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Notice, nothing is said about whether musketeers are galloping in one or two directions.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The musketeers could go:
<p>
a)	in different directions, towards each other;
<p>
b)	in different directions, moving away from each other;
<p>
c)	in one direction - Athos after Aramis;
<p>
d)	in one direction - Aramis after Athos.
<p>
Accordingly, the problem leads to four different answers. For example, in case a) in an hour the distance will decrease by 9 leagues and leaving 11 leagues. The remaining answers can also be found.

</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
11, 29, 21 or 19 leagues.
