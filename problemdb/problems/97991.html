<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  What is the minimum number of squares that need to be marked on a chessboard, so that:
</p>
<p>
  1) There are no horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent marked squares.
</p>
<p>
  2) Adding any single new marked square breakes rule 1.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Divide the square into 9 parts (see the diagram). Each part must contain one square, else this square can be added without breaking rule 1.
</p>

  E.g the nine black squares on the diagram obey both rules.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  9 squares
