<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  The numbers $1, 2,...,99$ are written on 99 cards. Then the cards are shuffled and placed with the number facing down. On the blank side of the cards, the numbers $1, 2, ..., 99$ are once again written.
</p>
<p>
  The sum of the two numbers on each card as calculated, and the product of these 99 summations is worked out. Prove that the end result will be an even number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Amongst the numbers $1, 2,...,99$ there are 50 odd numbers and 49 even numbers. This means that one of the cards is guaranteed to have an odd number on both sides, meaning its sum is even and so the product of all the sums must also be even.
