<h1>Problem ID 86508</h1>
<p>
On an island there are 1,234 residents, each of whom is either a knight $($who always tells the truth$)$ or a liar $($who always lies$)$. One day, all of the inhabitants of the island were broken up into pairs, and each one said: "He is a knight!" or "He is a liar!" about his partner. Could it eventually turn out to be that the number of "He is a knight!" and "He is a liar!" phrases is the same? 
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose that the described situation is possible. Then, each of the phrases is pronounced 1234/2 = 617 times.
There are only three possible types of pairs: two knights; two liars; a knight and a liar. In the pairs of the first and second types, each person said: "He is a knight!", and in the pairs of the third type, everyone said: "He is a liar!". Thus, each of the phrases is pronounced an even number of times, which contradicts the fact that there should be 617 phrases of each type.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	It cannot be.
