<h1>Problem ID 86508</h1>
<p>
Solving the problem: "What is the solution of the expression
$x^{2000}$ + $x^{1999}$ + $x^{1998}$ + $1000x^{1000}$ + $1000x^{999}$ + $1000x^{998}$ + $2000x^3$ + $2000x^2$ + 2000x + 3000 $($x is a real number$)$ if $x^2$ + x + 1 = 0? ",
Vasya got the answer of 3000. Is Vasya right?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since the polynomial $x^2$ + x + 1 does not have real roots, then from the fact that some number is its root $($false assertion$)$, everything follows, including the fact that the answer to the given expression is 3000.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
He is right.
