<h1>Problem ID 102797</h1>
<p>
Solve the equation [$x^3$] + [$x^2$] + [x] = {x} - 1.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
The number on the left is an integer, and therefore on the right the sum is also an integer, that is, {x} = 0. Hence, x is an integer, so the equation can be rewritten as $x^3$ + $x^2$ + x = -1, or $($x + 1$)$ $($$x^2$ + 1$)$ = 0.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
x = -1.
</p>
