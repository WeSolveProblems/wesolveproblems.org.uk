<h1>Problem ID 66016</h1>
<p>
George drew an empty table of size $50 \times 50$ and wrote on top of each column and to the left of each row, a number. It turned out that all 100 written numbers are different, and 50 of them are rational, and the remaining 50 are irrational. Then, in each cell of the table, he wrote down the sum of the numbers written at the start of the corresponding row and column $($ "addition table" $)$. What is the largest number of sums in this table that could be rational numbers?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Evaluation. Suppose that x irrational and 50 - x rational numbers are written along the left side of the table. Then along the upper side there are written 50 - x irrational and x rational numbers. Since the sum of rational and irrational numbers is always irrational, in the table there are at least
$x^2$ + $(50 - x)^2$ = 2 $(x - 25)^2$ + $2 \times 252$ $ ≥$ $2 \times 252$ = 1250 irrational numbers. Hence, there are no more than 2500 – 1250 = 1250 rational numbers.
Example: when there are exactly 1250 rational numbers in the table. We put along the left side the numbers 1, 2, ..., 24, 25, and along the top the numbers 26, 27, ..., 49, 50. Then there are only $2 \times 252$ = 1250 sums of rational and irrational numbers.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
1250 sums.
 
</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
Compare with the problem number 66022.
