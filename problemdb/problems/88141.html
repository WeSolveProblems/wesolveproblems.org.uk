<h1>Problem ID 88141</h1>
<p>
Write a number instead of the space $($in letters, not numbers!$)$ to get a true sentence:
<p>
THIS SENTENCE HAS ... LETTERS
<p>
$($Note that the dash does not count as a letter, i.e. the word twenty-two is made up of 9 letters$)$.

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Note: now there are twenty-two letters in the sentence.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Now there are twenty-two letters in the sentence. This means that we must insert a number of at least 22, which will add at least 9 letters. But if we insert numbers 28 or 29, the sentence does not become true. Hence, the required number is not less than 30, which adds, at least, the 6 letters. After going over all the numbers from 31 to 39, we get two possible answers "This sentence has thirty-one letters" or “This sentence has thirty-three letters”.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
"This sentence has thirty-one letters" or “This sentence has thirty-three letters”.
