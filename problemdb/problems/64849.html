<h1>Problem ID 64849</h1>
<p>
On a ring road at regular intervals there are 25 posts, each with a policeman. The police are numbered in some order from 1 to 25. It is required that they cross the road so that there is a policeman on each post, but so that number 2 was clockwise behind number 1, number 3 was clockwise behind number 2, and so on. Prove that if you organised the transition so that the total distance travelled was the smallest, then one of the policemen will remain at his original post.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
We will assume that the length of the road is 25. Suppose that when moving from the initial arrangement A to some "ordered" arrangement of B, each of the policemen moved $($of course, each of them moved along a smaller arc connecting its original position with the new one$)$. Let us prove that the total distance travelled can be reduced. At least 13 policemen went to a new location in one direction $($let it be clockwise$)$. Consider the arrangement C obtained from B by shifting each policeman one place counter clockwise. Now, when moving from A to C, at least 13 policemen have had their distance travelled reduced by 1, compared with the transition from A to B, while the others, if their distance travelled did increase, it did so by no more than 1. As a result, the total distance travelled has decreased by at least 1.
