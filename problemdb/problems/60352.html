<h1>Problem ID 60352</h1>
<p>
  A sack contains 70 marbles, 20 red, 20 blue, 20 yellow, and the rest black or white. What is the smallest number of marbles that need to be removed from the sack, without looking, in order for there to be no less than 10 marbles of the same colour among the removed marbles.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If we remove 37 marbles we risk getting 9 each of red, blue and yellow, and no set of 10 marbles of the same colour. If we remove 38 marbles then the overall total of red, blue, and yellow marbles is no less than 28, so the number of marbles of one colour is no less than 10 since $28> 3\times 9$.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  38.
