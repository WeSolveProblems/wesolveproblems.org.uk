<h1>Problem ID 35339</h1>
<p>On the planet Tau Ceti, the landmass takes up more than half the surface area. Prove that the Tau Cetians can drill a hole through the centre of their planet that connects land to land.</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>Imagine a projection of the land relative to the centre of the planet.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>The surface occupied by the land and the antipodal surface - that is, directly opposite - to the land overlap. If they did not then the land would take up less than half of the planet's surface area.</p>
