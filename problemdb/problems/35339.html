<h1>Problem</h1>
On the planet Tau Ceti land takes up more than half its surface area. Prove that the Tau Cetians can drill a hole through the centre of their planet that connects land to land.
<h1>Hint</h1>
Imagine a projection of the land relative to the centre of the planet.

<h1>Solution</h1>
The surface occupied by the land and the surface antipodal (directly opposite) to the land overlap. If they did not, then the land would take up less than half of the planet's surface area.
