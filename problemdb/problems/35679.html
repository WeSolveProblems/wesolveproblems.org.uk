<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Prove that there are 20 Londoners with the same number of hairs on their heads (it is known that a person has at most 400 000 hairs on their head, and that the population of London is no less than 8 million). </p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>If this was not the case, then London would have a population of no more than $19 \times (N+1) $ , where $ N $ is the maximum number of hairs on a person's head.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>We can divide the population of London into 400 001 groups. We can place all of those with 0 hairs into the first group, those with 1 hair into the second, those with 2 into the third, and so on, so that those in the 400 001th group have exactly 400 000 hairs.</p>
<p>We need to prove that one of these groups contains no less than 20 people. Let us assume that the opposite is true, and that no group contains more than 19 people. This would mean that the entire population of London would be at most $ 19 \times 400 001 $ which is less than 8 million. This contradicts the information given in the question, meaning that there will always be at least one group with more than 20 members.</p>
