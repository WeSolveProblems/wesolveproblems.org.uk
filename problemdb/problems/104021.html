<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  a) A 1 or a 0 is placed on each vertex of a cube. The sum of the 4 adjacent vertices is written on each face of the cube. Is it possible for each of the numbers written on the faces to be different?
</p>
<p>
  b) The same question, but if 1 and -1 are used instead.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  a) Notice there are 5 possible values that could be on each face $0, 1, 2, 3$ or $4$. But there are a total of 6 faces, meaning that by the Pigeon Hole Principle at least two faces must share a value.
</p>
<p>
  b) The solution is identical, but the 5 possible values are $-4, -2, 0, 2, 4$
