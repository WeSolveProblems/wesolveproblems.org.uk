<h1>Problem ID 32044</h1>
<p>
  What is the minimum number of lottery tickets for the sportlotto (choose 6 of the numbers 1 to 49) that it is necessary to buy, in order to guarantee that at least one of the tickets will have one number correct.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Fill out 8 lottery tickets as follows. On the first ticket pick the numbers 1 to 6, on the second - the numbers 7 to 12,  and so on until 43 to 48. The only number not marked on one of the cards will be the number 49. Therefore at least 5 of the winning numbers will have been picked on the bought tickets.
</p>
<p>
  We will prove that 7 tickets may not be sufficient. In total no more than 42 different numbers can be chosen with 7 tickets. Therefore at least 7 numbers will not have been marked on any of the tickets. It is possible, that 6 of these 7 unchosen numbers turn out to be the winning numbers.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  8 tickets.
