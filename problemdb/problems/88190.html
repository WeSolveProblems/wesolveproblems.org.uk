<h1>Problem ID 88190</h1>
<p>
Fred and George are twin brothers. One of them always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You can ask only one question to one of the brothers, to which he will answer "yes" or "no". Try to find out the name of each of the twins.
 
</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Remember tasks 140, 148, 149, 153.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
If we ask: "What will your brother answer to the question:" Are you George? "" - then in the answer we will always hear the wrong answer, since either the true answer or the true-false one will be falsely transmitted. Therefore George will say yes, and Fred - no.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1> <p>
 "What will your brother answer to the question:" Are you George? "
