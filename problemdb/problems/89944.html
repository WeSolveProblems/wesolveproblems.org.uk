<h1>Problem ID 89944</h1>
<p>
On an island live knights who always tell the truth, and liars who always lie. A traveler met three islanders and asked each of them: "How many knights are among your companions?". The first one answered: "Not one." The second one said: "One." What did the third man say?
 
</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Think whether the first respondent can be a knight.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suppose that the first is a knight, then the other two are liars, but then it turns out that the second one told the truth, therefore the first is a liar. Now the second. Suppose he is a liar, then the third is necessarily a knight, and it turns out that the second told the truth. So the second one is a knight. And this, in turn, means that the third one is also a knight, and he said "One".
