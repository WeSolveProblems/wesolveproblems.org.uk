<h1>Problem ID 79545</h1> <p>
	In a dark room on a shelf there are 4 pairs of socks of two different sizes and two different colours that are not arranged in pairs. What is the minimum number of socks necessary to move from the drawer to the suitcase, without leaving the room, so that there are two pairs of socks of different sizes and colours in the suitcase?


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
   First, we notice that seven socks are enough. Indeed, this means that all of the pairs of socks are taken, except one. Consequently, in the suitcase there were two pairs of different colours and sizes, namely the pair, which differs from the one only in colour,
and a pair which differs from the one only in size.
<p>
   If you leave one sock from each of the two pairs of the same colour in the drawer, then in the suitcase there will not be two pairs of different colours.
Consequently, six socks may not be enough.


</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
7 socks.
