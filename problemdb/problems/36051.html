<h1>Problem ID 36051</h1>
<p>
A tourist walked 3.5 hours, and for every period of time, in one hour, he walked exactly 5 km. Does this mean that his average speed is 5 km/h?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let him walk in the following way: he walks for half an hour at a speed of 10 km/h and rests for half an hour. Then in 3.5 hours he will walk 20 km, and his average speed is equal to 20/3.5 = 5 $\frac{5}{7}$ km/h.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
No, it doesnâ€™t.
</p>
