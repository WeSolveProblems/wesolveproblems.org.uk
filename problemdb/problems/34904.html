<h1>Problem</h1>
Is it possible to transport 50 stone blocks from a quarry, whose masses are equal to $370, 372,...,468$ kg on seven 3 tonne trucks?
<h1>Hint</h1>
One of the trucks will need to carry 8 stones

<h1>Solution</h1>
The sum of the masses of the 8 lightest stones is $370+372+...+384=3016$ kg which is greater than 3 tonnes. Therefore on one three tonne truck we can transport no more than 7 stones, and on 7 such trucks - no more than 49 stones.

<h1>Answer</h1>
No, it is not.
