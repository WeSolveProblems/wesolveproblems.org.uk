<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Is it possible to transport 50 stone blocks from a quarry, whose masses are equal to $370, 372,...,468$ kg on seven 3 tonne trucks?</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>One of the trucks will need to carry 8 stones</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>The sum of the masses of the 8 lightest stones is $370+372+...+384=3016$ kg which is greater than 3 tonnes. Therefore on one three tonne truck we can transport no more than 7 stones, and on 7 such trucks - no more than 49 stones.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>No, it is not.</p>
