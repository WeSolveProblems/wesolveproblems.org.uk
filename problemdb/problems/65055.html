<h1>Problem ID 65055</h1>
<p>
There are scales and 100 coins, among which several (more than 0 but less than 99) are fake. All of the counterfeit coins weigh the same and all of the real ones also weigh the same, while the counterfeit coin is lighter than the real one. You can do weighings on the scales by paying with one of the coins (whether real or fake) before weighing. Prove that it is possible with a guarantee to find a real coin.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We will put aside one coin. Since there are at least two real coins, among the remaining 99 coins there is at least one real coin. We number these coins and weigh the first with the second, paying for the weighing using the previously put aside coin. If one of the coins is outweighed, then it is real, and the problem is solved. If the weights of the first and second coins are equal, let us compare the second coin to the third coin by paying with the first coin for weighing. If one of the coins outweighed, the problem is solved. Otherwise, we will weigh the third coin with the fourth, paying for it with the second coin, etc. If at some point one of the coins outweighs the other, the problem is solved. If all of the 98 weights resulted in the scales being in equilibrium, then all 99 numbered coins weighed equally, and since there was a real one among them, all of them, including the two remaining after the 98th weighing, are real.
