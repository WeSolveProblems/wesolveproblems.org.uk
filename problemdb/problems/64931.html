<h1>Problem ID 64931</h1>
<p>
Author: E.V. Bakaev<p>

After a hockey match Anthony said that he scored 3 goals, and Ilya only one. Ilya said that he scored 4 goals, and Serge scored 5 goals. Serge said that he scored 6 goals, and Anthony only two. Could it be that the three of them scored 10 goals, if it is known that each of them once told the truth, and once lied?
<p>
<h1>Solution 1</h1></p>
  There are two possible cases. <p>

  1) Anthony told the truth about himself, that is, he scored 3 goals. Then Serge lied about Anthony, so about himself he said the truth, that is, he scored 6 goals. Therefore, Ilya lied about Serge and told the truth about himself, that is, he scored 4 goals. In this case, the boys scored in total
3 + 6 + 4 = 13 goals. <p>

  2) Anthony lied about himself. Then he told the truth about Ilya, that is, Ilya scored 1 goal. Then Ilya also lied about himself and told the truth about Serge: he scored 5 goals. Consequently, Serge lied about himself and told the truth about Anthony, that is, he scored 2 goals. In this case, the boys scored 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 goals in total. <p>


<p>
<h1>Solution 2</h1></p>
  In total, six statements were made, of which exactly three are true. For each of the boys, two different statements were made, one of which must be true and the other false. Therefore, Anthony scored either 3 goals or 2, Ilya - 1 or 4, and Serge - 5 or 6. The sum of 10 can be obtained in one way: if Anthony scored 3 goals, Ilya - one, and Serge - 6. However, saying "Anthony scored 3 goals, and Ilya - one ", was made by the same boy, so this situation is impossible.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
No.
