<h1>Problem ID 30420</h1>
<p>
There are 30 people in the class. Can it be that 9 of them have 3 friends $($in this class$)$, 11 have 4 friends, and 10 have 5 friends?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

To solve this problem, you can draw a graph. It would have 30 vertices, 9 of which would have degree 3, 11 would have degree 4 and 10 would have degree 5. However, there are 19 odd vertices in this graph, which contradicts problem number 87972 b).
