<h1>Problem ID 78602</h1>
<p>
  In order to encrypt telegraph signals, it is necessary to divide every possible 10 character 'word' - an arrangement of 10 dots and dashes - into two groups, so that any two words in the same group differed by no fewer than three characters. Find a method of doing this or prove that no such method exists.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider all of the words that start with the same combination of eight characters (dots and dashes). There are four such words, each of which must be in a different group, but there are only two groups Therefore the required grouping is not possible.
