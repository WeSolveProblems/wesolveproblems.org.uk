<h1>Hint</h1>
Think about how many banknotes there will be, if there are no more than 6 bankotes of each of the 4 denominations.
<h1>Solution</h1>
Yes, If each of there were no more than 6 banknotes of each of the 4 denominations, the maximimum number of banknotes is 24. However there are 25, so there must be at least one denomination of which there are 7 banknotes.
