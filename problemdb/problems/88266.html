<h1>Problem ID 88266</h1>
<p>
Two tribes live on the island: natives and newcomers. It is known that the natives always tell the truth and the newcomers always lie. A traveller hired an indigenous islander as a guide. On the way, they met a man. The traveller asked the guide to find out which tribe this person belongs to. The guide returned and said that the man said that he was a native. Who was the guide - a native or a newcomer?
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
Think about what the man that they met said to the guide.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
A second native, whoever he may be, would reply positively to the question: "are you native?". Hence, the guide did not deceive the traveller, and therefore he, too, is a native.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
The guide is a native.
