<h1>Problem ID 30273</h1>
<p>
Three wise men ride on a train. Suddenly the train drives into a tunnel, and after the lights come on, each of the men sees that the faces of his colleagues are stained with soot that has flown through the car window. All three begin to laugh at their stained companions, but suddenly the most intelligent man guesses that his face is also stained. How did he do it?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
He reasoned thus: "If my face is not stained, another man, seeing that the third is laughing at something, would understand that his face is stained, and would stop laughing. However, he laughs, therefore, my face is also stained."
</p>
