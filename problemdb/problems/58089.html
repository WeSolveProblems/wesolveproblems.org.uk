<h1>Problem ID 58089</h1>
<p>
  What is the minimum number of points necessary to mark inside a convex $n$-sided polygon, so that at least one marked point always lies inside any triangle whose vertices are shared with those of the polygon?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Since the diagonals going from one vertex divide the $n$-sided polygon into $n-2$ triangles, then $n-2$ points are necessary.
</p>
<p>
  From the diagram we can see how $n-2$ points can be placed to fulfil the requirements; it is sufficient to place one marked point in each of the black triangles. In fact, inside any triangle $A_pA_qA_r$ where $p \l q \l r$ there will always be a black triangle at vertex $A_q$
