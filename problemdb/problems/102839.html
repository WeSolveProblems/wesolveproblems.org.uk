<h1>Problem ID 102839</h1>
<p>
In the US, it is customary to record the date as follows: the number of the month, then the number of the day and then the year. In Europe, the number comes first, then the month and then the year. How many days are there in the year, the date of which can be read definitively, without knowing how it was written?

</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Obviously, these are the days in which the number of the day can be the number of the month, that is, it takes the values from 1 to 12. There are $12 \times 12$ = 144 such days. But those days, in which the number coincides with the number of the month, are understood unambiguously. Therefore, there are 144 - 12 = 132 desired days.
