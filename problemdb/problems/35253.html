<h1>Problem ID 35253</h1>
<p>
How can one measure out 15 minutes, using an hourglass of 7 minutes and 11 minutes?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The hourglasses can be turned over even if there is still some sand in it.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
</p>
Let the first hourglass be the 7 minute one, and the second the 11 minute one. Let's turn both of these hourglasses over at the same time.
<p>

The first way. After 7 minutes, let’s turn over the first hourglass, and after 4 minutes, that is, when there is no sand in the second hourglass, let’s turn the hourglass over again. At this moment, in the first hourglass, there will be sand for 4 minutes, and at the top - for 3 minutes. So, if we turn over the first hourglass, we can measure out another 4 minutes.
<p>
The second way. After 7 minutes, that is, when all of the sand has reached the bottom in the first hourglass, the second hour will have 4 minutes of sand at the top. From this moment, we start counting. As soon as all of the sand has gone down in the second hourglass, we turn it over and measure out another 11 minutes.
