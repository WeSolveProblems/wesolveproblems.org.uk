<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  The numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 10$ are written around a circle in a particular order. Peter calculated the sum of each of the 10 possible groups of three adjacent numbers around the circle and wrote down the smallest value he had calculated. What is the largest possible value he could have written down?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Discount the number 10 for a moment. Divide the remaining nine numbers into three triplets of adjacent numbers. The total value of these three triplets must equal $1+2+3+...+9 = 45$, therefore at least one of the sums of triplets cannot exceed $45 \div 3 = 15$.
</p>
<p>
  For example, we could arrange the numbers as follows, so that the number Peter writes down is 15: $1, 5, 9, 2, 7, 6, 8, 3, 4, 10$
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  15
</p>

<p>
  The example given is not the only one possible.
