<h1>Problem ID 104011</h1>
<p>
On Easter Island, people ask each other questions, to which only "yes" or "no" can be answered. In this case, each of them belongs exactly to one of the tribes either A or B. People from tribe A ask only those questions to which the correct answer is "yes", and from tribe B - those questions to which the correct answer is "no." In one house lived a couple Ethan and Violet Russell. When Inspector Krugg approached the house, the owner met him on the doorstep with the words: "Tell me, do Violet and I belong to tribe B?". The inspector thought and gave the right answer. What was the right answer?
