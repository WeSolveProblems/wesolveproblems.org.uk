<h1>Problem ID 103824</h1>
<p>
A globe has 17 parallels and 24 meridians. How many parts is the globeâ€™s surface divided into? The meridian is an arc connecting the North Pole with the South Pole. A parallel is a circle parallel to the equator $($the equator is also a parallel$)$.
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Solve the problem for two meridians and one parallel.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Meridians divide the globe into 24 parts $($slices$)$, and the parallels divide each slice into 17 + 1 = 18 pieces. Therefore, we have $18 \times 24$ = 432 parts in total.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Into 432 parts.
