<h1>Problem ID 57207</h1>
<p>
Construct the triangle ABC by the medians $m_a, m_b$ and $m_c$.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose that the triangle ABC is constructed. Let $AA_1, BB_1$ and $CC_1$ be its medians, M be the point of their intersection, M' be a point symmetric to M relative to point $A_1$. Then MM' = $2m_a$ / 3, MC = $2m_c$ / 3 and M'C = $2m_b$ / 3, so the triangle MM'C can be constructed. Point A is symmetric to M' relative to point M, and point B is symmetric to C relative to the midpoint of MM'.
