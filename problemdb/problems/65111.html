<h1>Problem ID 65111</h1>
<p>
At a round table, 2015 people are sitting down, each of them is either a knight or a liar. Knights always tell the truth, liars always lie. They were given one card each, and on each card a number is written; all the numbers on the cards are different. Looking at the cards of their neighbours, each of those sitting at the table said: "My number is greater than that of each of my two neighbors." After that, k of the sitting people said: "My number is less than that of each of my two neighbors." At what maximum k could this occur?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let A and B be people who got cards with the largest and smallest numbers, respectively. Because they both said the first sentence, A is a knight, and B is a liar. Therefore, none of them could have pronounced the second phrase. Therefore, k $â‰¤$ 2013.
The situation when the remaining 2013 people can say the second phrase is possible. Let those sitting at the table $($ clockwise $)$ get cards with the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 2015; while the card with the number 2015 went to a knight, and the rest - to the liars. Then the first phrase can be said by everyone, and the second phrase - everyone, except for the people with the cards numbered 1 and 2015.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
For k = 2013.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
There are other examples of card distribution, in which 2013 people can say the second phrase.
