<h1>Problem ID 65330</h1>
<p>
In the set -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, replace one number with two other integers so that the set variance and its mean remain unchanged.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
As is known, the variance of a set is equal to the difference between the mean square and the square of the mean. Therefore, the problem can be rephrased: it is necessary to replace one number with two others so that both the arithmetic mean and the mean square of the numbers in the collection do not change. The arithmetic average of this set is 0, so the arithmetic mean of the new set, and therefore the sum of the numbers in it, must also be 0.
In this set there are 11 numbers, and the sum of the squares is $2 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)$ = 110, so the average square is 10. In the new set of 12 numbers, the sum of the squares of the numbers of the new set must be 120, therefore there is an increase of 10. We replace the number a with the numbers b and c. Then a = b + c and $a^2$ + 10 = $b^2$ + $c^2$. Therefore, $b^2$ + $c^2$ - 10 = $(b + c)^2$ = $b^2$ + $c^2$ + 2bc, whence bc = -5.
Hence, one of the numbers is equal to 5 or -5, and the other, respectively, -1 or 1. In the first case, a = 4, in the second case a = -4.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
It is necessary to replace -4 by 1 and -5 or replace 4 with -1 and 5.
