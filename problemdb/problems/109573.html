<h1>Problem ID 109573</h1>
<p>
Author: N. K. Agakhanov
<p>
Prove that for all x, 0 $<$ x $<$ π/3, we have the inequality
sin 2x + cos x $>$ 1.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Using the identities $1 cos x = 2 sin^2 x/2, sin 2x = 4 sin x/2 cos x/2 cos x$, we reduce the inequality to the form 2 cos x $>$ tan x/2. This inequality is valid because 2 cos x $>$ 2 cos π/3 = 1, tan x/2 $<$ tan π/6 $<$ 1. Note that the functions sin2x and cos x are convex upward on the interval [0, π/3]. Hence, their sum $f (x) = sin2x + cos x $ is also convex, so the graph of f $(x)$ on this interval does not lie below the line joining the points $(0; f (0))$ and $(π/3; f (π/3))4. The required inequality now follows from the relations $f (0) = 1$ and $f (π/3) = ½ + \sqrt{3} /2 $>$ 1$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
