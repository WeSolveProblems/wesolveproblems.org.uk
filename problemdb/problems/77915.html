<h1>Problem ID 77915</h1>
<p>
Numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 101 are written out in a row in some order. Prove that one can cross out 90 of them so that the remaining 11 will be arranged in their magnitude $($either increasing or decreasing$)$.


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Let the numbers be written out in the order $a_1, ..., a_{100}; x_k$ and $y_k$ are respectively the largest lengths of increasing and decreasing sequences starting with $a_k$. Suppose that $x_k ≤ 10$ and $y_k ≤ 10$ for all k. Then the number of all different pairs $($x_k, y_k$)$ does not exceed 100. Therefore, $x_k = x_l$ and $y_k = y_l$ for some numbers k $<$ l. But this cannot be: if $a_k $<$ a_l$, then $x_k $>$ x_l$, and if $a_k $>$ a_l$, then $y_k$ $>$ $y_l$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above. 

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
1.	This task was not solved by any of the participants in the Olympiad.

2. Similarly, one can prove that any sequence of mn + 1 pairwise distinct numbers contains either an increasing sequence of m + 1 numbers or a decreasing sequence of n + 1 numbers.
