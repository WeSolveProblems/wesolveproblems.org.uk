<h1>Problem ID 88131</h1>
<p>
Three tourists must move from one bank of the river to another. At their disposal is an old boat, which can withstand a load of only 100 kg. The weight of one of the tourists is 45 kg, the second - 50 kg, the third - 80 kg. How should they act to move to the other side?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The tourists can start with the fact that the two that weigh less board the boat and cross to the opposite shore, after which one of them brings the boat back. Remember task 512.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The tourists can act as follows: 1) the two that weigh less board the boat and cross to the opposite shore; 2) one of them brings the boat back; 3) the heaviest tourist gets into the boat and crosses; 4) the second lightest tourist gets onto the boat and takes it back; 5) the two lightest get into the boat and finally pass to the other side.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	The two lightest tourists are transferred; one of them takes the boat back; the heavy one is transported; the second light tourist takes the boat back; the two lightest take the boat to the other shore once again.
