<h1>Problem ID 32095</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to draw this picture $($see the figure$)$, without taking your pencil off the paper and going along each line only once?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Letâ€™s number the three squares which make up this figure. Let's start drawing the first square from any of its points until we reach the point of intersection with the second square. Then we interrupt the outline of the first square and draw the second one until we reach its point of intersection with the third one. Then we draw the third square completely, then finish the second one, followed by the first one. Each time we will finish drawing a square at the same point at which we started, that is, at the point of intersection with the previous square.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes, it is possible.

2. Compare with problem number 30808.
