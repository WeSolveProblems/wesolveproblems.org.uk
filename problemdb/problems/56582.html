<h1>Problem ID 56582</h1>
<p>
The diagonals of the trapezium ABCD with the bases AD and BC intersect at the point O; the points B' and C' are symmetrical to the vertices B and C with respect to the bisector of the angle BOC. Prove that $\angle$C'AC = $\angle$B'DB.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Due to symmetry with respect to the bisector of the angle BOC, the lines AC and DB intersect each other, so we need to prove that $\angle$C'AB'= $\angle$B'DC'. Since BO = B'O, CO = C'O and AO/ DO = CO/ BO, then $AO \times B'O$ = $DO \times C'O$, that is, the quadrangle AC'B'D is inscribed and $\angle$C'AB '= $\angle$B'DC'.
