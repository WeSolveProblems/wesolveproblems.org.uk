<h1>Problem ID 88264</h1>
<p>
Ten people wanted to found a club. To do this, they need to collect a certain amount of entrance fees. If the organizers were five people more, then each of them would have to pay $100 less. How much money did each one pay?
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to present the condition of the problem in the form of a system of equations. Think about how to solve this problem without composing a system of equations.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Denote the amount of the entrance fee by x. Then we can form the equation 10x = 15 $($x - 100$)$, having decided which, we define x = 300 dollars. It would be possible to solve this problem without making an equation, arguing as follows: the $100 that will be saved by 10 original members of the club will be paid by 5 new members, i.e. each of 5 will pay $200. Thus, with 15 members of the club, the total fee is $ 200\times 15$ = $ 3000. Hence, for 10 participants the membership fee was equal to $($3000/10$)$ = 300 dollars.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
300 dollars.
