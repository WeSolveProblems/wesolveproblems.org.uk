<h1>Problem ID 65956</h1>
<p>
Some cells of a white rectangle measuring $3\times7$ were randomly coloured black. Prove that it is always possible to find four cells of the same colour, the centres of which are the vertices of some rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Consider the first two lines. If the rectangle formed by these two columns is white $($black$)$, then the required rectangle is found.
Otherwise, cells of different colours are located in at least five columns. Then, in no fewer than three columns, the black and white cells will be arranged in the same order, for example, from the top - black, from below - white.
</p>
Consider these three columns and the third row. In the third row and in the columns, consider that there must be at least two cells of the same colour. If they are black, then the desired rectangle is formed from their centres and the centres of black cells of the first row, and if they are white, then the desired rectangle is formed from their centres together with the centres of white cells of the second row.
