<h1>Problem ID 103744</h1>
<p>
Find numbers equal to twice the sum of their digits.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
If the first digit of a two-digit number is a, and the second is b, then the number itself is 10a + b.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
It is easy to see that there are no single-digit numbers greater than zero with the required property. Let's try to find a solution among two-digit numbers. If the first digit of a two-digit number is a, and the second is b, then the number itself is 10a + b. We have 10a + b = 2$($a + b$)$. Hence 8a = b, that is, a = 1, b = 8.
It can be shown that there are no other solutions $($idea: the smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest sum of three digits is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27$)$. But this was not required at the Olympiad.

0; 18.
