<h1>Problem ID 35161</h1>
<p>
One of n prizes is embedded in each chewing gum pack, where each prize has probability 1/n of being found. 
How many packets of gum, on average, should I buy to collect the full collection prizes? 

</p> 
<h1>Hint</h1> 
<p>
In a situation where k prizes have already been collected, calculate the average number of chewing gum packs that need to be purchased so that the last chewing gum pack adds a new prize.

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Suppose we already have k prizes. Letâ€™s calculate how long we need to wait for the next prize. We call a chewing gum pack new, if the in it prize is not found among the k already collected prizes. We denote by $M_k$ the average number of chewing gum packs that need to be purchased, so that the last bought chewing gum pack is new. Consider the next chewing gum pack that is bought. It is new with probability $\frac{n-k}{n} $($and the expectation of the (k + 1)-th chewing gum pack means that the collection ends$)$, and with probability k/n it is not new $($in this case, once we buy one chewing gum pack, we are again in the state when the average number of chewing gum packs you need to buy before buying a new one is M_k$)$. Therefore, $M_k$ = $(n-k)/n \times 1 + k/n \times (M_k + 1)$, from where $M_k$ = $n/(n-k)$. Hence, the average number of chewing gum packs that need to be purchased for a complete collection of prizes is $M_0 + M_1 + ... + M_{n-1} = n/n + n/(n-1) + ... + n/1 = n (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n)$.

</p> 
<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
n$($1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n)$.
