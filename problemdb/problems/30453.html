<h1>Problem ID 30453</h1>
<p>
Two people take turns drawing noughts and crosses on a $9 \times 9$ grid. The first player uses crosses and the second player uses noughts. After they finish, the number of rows and columns where there are more crosses than noughts are counted, and these are the points which the first player receives. The number of rows and columns where there are more noughts than crosses are the second player's points. The player who has the most points is the winner. Who wins, if the right strategy is used?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first player wins. The strategy is to draw a cross in the central square during their first turn and for their following turns to draw a cross using central symmetry, depending on where the second player drew their nought.
