<h1>Problem ID 35167</h1>
<p>
On a $100 \times 100$ board 100 rooks are placed that cannot capturing one another.
Prove that an equal number of rooks is placed in the upper right and lower left cells of $50 \times 50$ squares.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
50 rooks are arranged on the 50 upper rows and 50 rooks in the 50 left columns.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Divide the board into four $50 \times 50$ squares. Let k be the number of rooks that stand in the upper left square. The left and right upper squares together form 50 top rows and therefore, 50 rooks are located on them. Hence, in the upper right square there are 50 - k rooks. Similarly, the number of rooks in the left bottom square can be calculated – there is also 50 – k of them.
