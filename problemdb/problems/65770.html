<h1>Problem ID 65770</h1>
<p>
The shooter shoots at 3 targets until he shoots everything. The probability of a hit with one shot is p.
<p>
a)	Find the probability that he needs exactly 5 shots.
<p>
b)	Find the mathematical expectation of the number of shots.
</p>

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
a)	The desired event occurs only if the first four shots have given two downed targets, and the last shot was successful. The probability of this is <img src="65770.png">
 
<p>
  b) When the probability of a hit is p, the average number of shots needed to bring down the first target is 1/p. This is intuitively understandable, but strictly follows from the properties of the geometric distribution. This means that 1/p shots are required for the second target and the same number for the third one.

</p> 
<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
a)	$6p^3 (1-p)^2$; b) 3/p.
