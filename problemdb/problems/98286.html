<h1>Problem ID 98286</h1>
<p>
Author: G.A. Galperin
<p> 
n numbers are given as well as their product, p. The difference between p and each of these numbers is an odd number.
Prove that all n numbers are irrational.
  
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Let x be one of these n numbers, $x + b_1, x + b_2, ..., x + b_{n-1}$ be the remaining ones and $p = x (x + b_1) (x + b_2) ... (x + b_{n- 1}) = x + c, (*)$
<p>
where, by the condition of the problem, c is odd, and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n-1}$ are even, since b_i = (p - x) - (p - (x + b_i)) is the difference of two odd numbers. The equality $(*)$ can be written, by opening the brackets, in the form $x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + a_2x^{n-2} + ... + a_{n-2}x^2 + a_{n-1}x-c = 0, (**)$
where $a_1, ..., a_{n-2}$ are even, and $a_{n-1} = b_1b_2 ... b{n-1} â€“ 1$ and c are odd. According to problem number 61013, all rational roots of this equation are integers. But x cannot be a whole number since for the integer x, the left hand side is odd. Consequently, the number x is irrational.
