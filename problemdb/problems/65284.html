<h1>Problem ID 65284</h1>
<p>
Hannah and Emma have three coins. On different sides of one coin there are scissors and paper, on the sides of another coin - a rock and scissors, on the sides of the third - paper and a rock. Scissors defeat paper, paper defeats rock and rock wins against scissors. First, Hannah chooses a coin, then Emma, then they throw their coins and see who wins $($if the same image appears on both, then it's a draw$)$. They do this many times. Is it possible for Emma to choose a coin so that the probability of her winning is higher than that of Hannah?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Let Hannah choose the coin "Scissors - paper". If Emma chooses the coin "Stone-scissors", then Hannah has a probability of ¼ of winning, and Emma has a probability of ½ $($with a probability of ¼ of a draw$)$.
Emma makes a similar choice when faced with the two other possibilities of coins that Hannah could pick.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
There is.
