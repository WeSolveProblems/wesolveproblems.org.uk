<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>In the number 1234096... each digit, starting with the 5th digit is equal to the final digit of the sum of the previous 4 digits. Will the digits 8123 ever occur in that order in a row in this number?</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>What digit follows the digits 8123?</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p> Note that according to the rule for constructing a sequence, the number preceding the four digits is uniquely determined by the four known. I.e. if the quadruple 1234 is encountered again in the sequence (not at the beginning), then the digit preceding this group of 4 digits must be equal to 8, and so in the sequence the pattern 8123 would be seen. It remains to prove that the group of four digits 1234 will meet in the sequence even once after the beginning. Since there is a finite number of possible four-digit numbers, two identical quadruples of numbers will occur in the sequence in different places at some point. The figures preceding these four will also have to be the same. Therefore, the quartets of numbers obtained from the initial shift by one digit to the left are also the same. Reasoning like this, we reach two identical quadruples, one of which is located at the beginning of the sequence (that is, this quadruple is 1234). In other words, the sequence must cycle back at some point to the same starting sequence, meaning the digits 8123 must occur somewhere.
