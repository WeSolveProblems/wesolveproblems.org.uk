<h1>Problem ID 35676</h1>
<p>
Let x be a natural number. Among the statements: 
<p>
2x is more than 70;
<p>
x is less than 100;
<p>
3x is greater than 25;
<p>
x is not less than 10;
<p>
x is greater than 5;
<p>
three are true and two are false. What is x?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Simplify the first and third statements; conduct a case analysis.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The first statement is equivalent to x $>$ 35, and the third assertion is equivalent to x $>$ 8, since x is a natural number. The first statement is incorrect, since if it were true, then the third, fourth, and fifth statements would also be true; and so there would be at least 4 correct statements. Therefore, x does not exceed 35. It follows that the second assertion is true. But then the fourth statement is incorrect $($otherwise the third and fifth statements would be true, and again we would get at least 4 correct statements$)$. Hence the conclusion: assertions 3 and 5 are true. And from the infidelity of the fourth statement and the validity of the third statement, it immediately follows that x = 9.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
X = 9
</p>
