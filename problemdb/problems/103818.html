<h1>Problem ID 103818</h1>
<p>
Which rectangles with whole sides are there more of: with perimeter of 1996 or with perimeter of 1998? $($The rectangles $a \times b$ and $b \times a$ are assumed to be the same$)$.
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
If the perimeter of the rectangle is 1996, then the sum of the lengths of its neighbouring sides is equal to 998.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If the perimeter of the rectangle is 1996, then the sum of the lengths of its neighbouring sides is 998. Hence, the length of the smaller side can take values from 1 to 499. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 1998, then the sum of the lengths of its neighbouring sides is 999, and the length of the smaller side can take those same values: from 1 to 499. That is, in both cases, the number of rectangles is the same, namely, 499.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
There is the same number of rectangles.
