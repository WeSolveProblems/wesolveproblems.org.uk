<h1>Problem ID 64576</h1>
<p>
Author: A.V. Khachaturyan<p>

Replace the letters of the word MATEMATIKA with numbers and signs of addition and subtraction so that a numeric expression equal to 2014 is obtained.
(The same letters denote the same numbers or signs, different letters denote different numbers or signs. Note that it is enough to give an example.)

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
183 + 1839 - 8.
</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
  1. To find a solution (and also to prove its uniqueness), it is useful to think about which of the letters are signs of action. <p>

  Clearly, this can not be A $($as the last character of the expression$)$. Then there must be at least one sign between the first two digits of A. The T sign can not be a minus or a plus $($even MA + EMA + IKA is known to be less than 99 + 999 + 899 $<$2000$)$. A small search shows that $($even if we assume that an expression can begin with a plus or minus sign$)$ M also can not be a sign. <p>

  There remains the case when plus is E, and somewhere else there is a minus. The expression MAT + MAT - IKA is known to be less than 2000, so the minus is not I, but K. The expression MAT + MATI - A is equal to MAT · 11 + (I - A), so MAT · 11 = 2013 $($other numbers divisible by 11 are too  far from 2014$)$ - this leads to a single answer. <p>
