<h1>Problem ID 116208</h1>
<p>
At the vertices of the hexagon ABCDEF $($see Fig.$)$ There were 6 identical balls: at A - one with mass 1 g, at B - 2 g, ..., at F - 6 g. Callum changed the places of two balls in opposite vertices. A set of weighing scales with 2 
plates is available, which let you know which plate contains the balls of greater mass. How, in one weighing, can it be determined which balls were rearranged?

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Put the balls from the vertices A and E on the left scale, and on the right side from the vertices B and D. If the joker swapped the balls at the vertices A and D, then the left-hand plate would have a weight of 4 + 5 = 9 grams, and right - 1 + 2 = 3 grams, and the left plate will outweigh the right one. If he swapped the balls at the vertices B and E, then on the left and right plates there will be 1 + 2 = 3 and 4 + 5 = 9 grams respectively, that is, the right plate will outweigh the left one. Finally, if he swapped the balls at the vertices of C and F, then 1 + 5 = 6 and 2 + 4 = 6 grams, that is, the balance will be in equilibrium. Thus, by the position of the weights, you can determine which balls have been swapped by Callum.
