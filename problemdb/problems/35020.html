<h1>Problem ID 35020</h1>
<p>
  10 people collected a total of 46 mushrooms in a forest. It is known that no two of these people collected the same number of mushrooms. How many mushrooms did each person collect?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Order the people in order of increasing number of mushrooms collected $a_o < a_1 < ... < a_9$. It is clear that $a_0> \ge 0, a_1 \ge 1, ..., a_9 \ge 9$. Leave each person the number of mushrooms that corresponds to their number. Then the people will have a total of $0+1+...+9=45$ mushrooms. Therefore we took away exactly one mushroom. Only person number 9 could have collected that mushroom, otherwise two people would have collected the same number of mushrooms.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10$ mushrooms. </p>
