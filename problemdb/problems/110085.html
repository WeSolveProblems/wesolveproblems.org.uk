<h1>Problem ID 110085</h1>
<p>
The real numbers x and y are such that for any distinct prime odd p and q the number $x^p$ + $y^q$ is rational. Prove that x and y are rational numbers.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
From the rationality of $x^p$ + $y^q$, $x^r$ + $y^q$, $x^s$ + $y^q$, the rationality of the numbers $x^r$ - $x^p$, $x^s$ - $x^r$ follows. We take p = 3, r = 5, s = 7. Then a = $x^7$ - $x^5$ and b = $x^5$ - $x^3$ are rational. If b = 0, then x = 0 or x = ± 1, that is, x is rational. If b ≠ 0, then x² = a / b is rational. But then the equality b = $x^2$ $(x^2 - 1)$x implies the rationality of x. Similarly, y is a rational number.
