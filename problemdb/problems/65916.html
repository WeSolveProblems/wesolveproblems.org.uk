<h1>Problem ID 65916</h1>
<p>
100 switched on and 100 switched off lights are randomly arranged in two boxes. Each flashlight has a button, the button of which turns off an illuminated flashlight and switches on a turned off flashlight. Your eyes are closed and you can not see if the flashlight is on. But you can move the flashlights from a box to another box and press the buttons on them. Think of a way to ensure that the burning flashlights in the boxes are equally split.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
First, move all the flashlights into the right box, without touching the switches. Next, move from the right box to the left box any hundred flashlights, while switching each, and the goal will be achieved. Let us prove this.
Let's switch exactly k lights on. So, k left lights were turned off and 100 - k were switched on. And in the right box there are 100 - k switched on and k switched off.
