<h1>Problem ID 108604</h1>
<p>
On the sides AB, BC and AC of the triangle ABC points P, M and K are taken so that the segments AM, BK and CP intersect at one point and

Prove that P, M and K are the midpoints of the sides of the triangle ABC.

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
We note $($Fig. 1$)$ that

This means that from the segments AK, CM and BP, you can make a triangle similar to this one. Consequently, the sides share the same ratio.
Then you can argue the rest in different ways.
<p>
The first method. By Cheva's theorem $($see Problem 53856$)$, this is possible only when this ratio is 1.
<p>
The second method. Let

We denote by G the intersection point of the medians $AA_1$, $BB_1$ and $CC_1$ of the triangle ABC $($Figure 2$)$. Suppose that p $<$ 1/2. Then the intersection point of the segments AM and BK lies inside the triangle $AB_1G$, and the point of intersection of the segments CP and BK is inside the triangle $BC_1G$, which is impossible $($these points coincide by the condition$)$. Similarly, the case when p $>$ 1/2 is rejected. Therefore, p = 1/2.
