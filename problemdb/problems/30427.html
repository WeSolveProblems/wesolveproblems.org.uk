<h1>Problem ID 30427</h1>
<p>
In the country Seven there are 15 cities, each of which is connected by roads with no less than seven other cities. Prove that from every city you can get to any other city $($possibly passing through other cities$)$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Consider two arbitrary cities and assume that they are not connected by a route, that is, a sequence of roads in which the beginning of the next road coincides with the end of the previous one. Each of these two cities is, by condition, connected with not less than seven others; while all the mentioned cities are different - after all, if any two of them coincide then the route connecting the original cities will coincide. Thus, we counted at least 16 cities. This is contradiction.
