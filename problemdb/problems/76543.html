<h1>Problem ID 76543</h1>
<p>
Prove that, for any integer n, among the numbers n, n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + 9 there is at least one number that is mutually prime with the other nine numbers.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Among these numbers five are odd. Letâ€™s consider the remainder when these numbers are divided by 3, 5 and 7. Among the remainders from division by 3, no three are identical, and among the remainders from division by 5 and 7 no two are identical. Therefore, among the five numbers it is possible to choose three numbers that are not multiples of 3, and a number that is not a multiple of either 5 or 7. This number is mutually prime with the remaining nine numbers.
