<h1>Problem ID 116849</h1>
<p>
2012 pine cones lay under the fir-tree. Winnie the Pooh and the donkey Eeyore play a game: they take turns picking up these pine cones. Winnie-the-Pooh takes either one or four cones in each of his turns, and Eeyore - either one or three. Winnie the Pooh goes first. The player who cannot make a move loses. Which of the players can be guaranteed to win, no matter how their opponent plays?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
In his first move Winnie the Pooh can take four pine cones, and then take one pine cone with each subsequent turn. In this case, after every move of the donkey, under the tree there will be an odd number of cones. Since the number of cones under the tree will gradually decrease, then inevitably there will come a time when under the fir tree there will be only one pine cone. Taking it, Winnie the Pooh will win.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Winnie the Pooh.
