<h1>Problem ID 86118</h1>
<p>
The numbers a and b are such that the first equation of the system
<p>
sin x + a = bx
<p>
cos x = b
<p>
has exactly two solutions. Prove that the system has at least one solution.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
By hypothesis, the function y = sin x + a - b x vanishes exactly at two points $x-1$ and $x_2$, $x_14 $<$ $x_2$.
These points divide the numerical axis into 3 intervals $($-∞, $x_1$], $($x_1$, $x_2$], $($x_2$, + ∞$)$, Since b ≠ 0 and | sin x | $≤$ 1, then on the intervals $(-∞, x_1)$ and $(x_2, + ∞)$ the function has different signs, therefore on some two adjacent intervals $(-∞, x_1)$, $(x_1, x_2)$ or $(x_1, x_2)$, $(x_2, + ∞)$ the function has the same sign, and then either the point $x_1$ or the point $x_2$ is an extremum point and the derivative on it is y '= $($sin x + a – bx$)$' = cos x - b vanishes.
