<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  A plane contains $n$ straight lines, of which no two are parallel. Prove that some of the angles will be smaller than $180^\circ/n$
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Choose a random point in the plane and draw straight lines through it parallel to those given. They divide the plane into $2n$ angles, which have a total of $360^\circ$ . Therefore one of the angles must be smaller than $180^\circ/n$
