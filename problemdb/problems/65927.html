<h1>Problem ID 65927</h1>
<p>
A tennis tournament takes place in a sports club. The rules of this tournament are as follows. The loser of the tennis match is eliminated (there are no draws in tennis). The pair of players for the next match is determined by a coin toss. The first match is judged by an external judge, and every other match must be judged by a member of the club who did not participate in the match and did not judge earlier. Could it be that there is no one to judge the next match?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let n matches take place at a certain moment in time. Hence, n people have been eliminated. As the first match was judged by an external judge, no more than n - 1 eliminated contestants participated in the judging. Thus, the next match has someone to judge it.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
No, it cannot be that there is no one to judge the next match.
