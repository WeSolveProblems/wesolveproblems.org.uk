<h1>Problem ID 111236</h1>
<p>
There is a kingdom inhabited by liars and knights. The knights always tell the truth and the liars always lie. The knights always carry a sword with them but the liars do not. Two knights and two liars met and looked at each other. Which of them could say the phrase: 
<br>
1) "All of us are knights." 
<br>
2) "Only one of you is a knight." 
<br>
3) "Exactly two of you are knights."

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
1) A knight could not have said this, since this is not true. This means that any of the liars could have said that.
<br>
2) Any of the knights could have said this since it would true for them. Any of the liars could also have said that, since it would be a lie for them.
<br>
3) Nobody could have said this since for any knight this statement would be false, and for any liar tis statement would be true.
