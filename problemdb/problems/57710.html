<h1>Problem ID 57710</h1>
<p>
Several points are given and for some pairs $($A, B$)$ of these points the vectors $\overrightarrow{AB}$ are taken, and at each point the same number of vectors begin and end. Prove that the sum of all the chosen vectors is $\overrightarrow{0}$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We take an arbitrary point O and write all the selected vectors in the form $\overrightarrow{$A_iA_j$}$ = $\overrightarrow{$OA_j$}$ - $\overrightarrow{$OA_i$}$. By the condition of the problem, each vector $\overrightarrow{$OA_i$}$ will be counted in the sum of all selected vectors with a plus sign the same number of times as those with a minus sign.
