<h1>Problem ID 35342</h1>
<p>
Two tribes live on an island: aborigines and aliens. Aborigines always tell the truth, and aliens always lie. A traveler who came to the island hired an islander to guide him. They went and saw another islander. The traveler sent the guide to find out to which tribe this native belongs. The guide returned and said: "The native says that he is an aborigine." Who was the guide: an alien or an aborigine?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Think about the question which the guide-islander could ask.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
From the message of the guide it follows that the guide is an aborigine. Indeed, the answer of the fellow islander could be only one: I am an aborigine, since this answer is true for the aborigine and a lie for the alien. Therefore, the guide told the truth, and therefore he belongs to the aborigines.
