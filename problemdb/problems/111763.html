<h1>Problem ID 111763</h1>
<p>
The quadratic trinomials f $(x)$ and g $(x)$ are such that f' $(x)$ g' $(x)$ $≥$ | f $(x)$ | + | g $(x)$ | for all real x. Prove that the product f $(x)$ g $(x)$ is equal to the square of some trinomial.
 
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let u and v be the abscissas of the vertices of the parabolas y = f $(x)$ and y = g $(x)$. Then f $(x)$ = a $(x - u)^2$ + b, g $(x)$ = c $(x - v)^2$ + d $(a, c ≠ 0)$, and the original inequality can be rewritten as 4ac $(x - u)$ $(x - v)$ $≥$ | a $(x - u)^2$ + b | + | c $(x - v)^2$ + d |. Substituting x = u into this inequality, we obtain
| b | + | c $(x - v)^2$ + d | $≤$ 0, from which we get that b = 0 and c $(u - v)^2$ + d = 0. By analogy, d = 0; therefore, from the previous equality it follows that u = v. Since 4ac $(x - u)$ 2 $≥$ 0 for all x, we get that ac $>$ 0. Therefore
