<h1>Problem ID 73741</h1>
<p>
An infinite sequence of numbers is given. Prove that for any natural number n that is relatively prime with a number 10, you can choose a group of consecutive digits, which when written as a sequence of digits, gives a resulting number written by these digits which is divisible by n.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
We assume that we are given an infinite sequence of digits $a_1, a_2, ..., a_i, ...,$ written from left to right. Consider the numbers: $a_m, a_{m-1}a_m, a_{m-2}a_{m-1}a_m, ..., a_1a_2 ... a_m$. If m$>$n, then there are two numbers $a_{m-i} ... a_m$ and $a_{m-j} ... a_m$, where i $<$ j, giving the same remainder when divided by n. Therefore, their difference $a_{m-j} ... a_{m-i-1}0 ... 0 = 10^{i + 1}a_{m-j} ... a_{m-i-1} $ is divisible by n.
By assumption, n and 10 are relatively prime, hence $a_{m-j}a_{m-i-1}$ is divisible by n.
