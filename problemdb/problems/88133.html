<h1>Problem ID 88133</h1>
<p>
Try to decipher this excerpt from the book “Alice Through the Looking Glass”: “Zkhq L xvh d zrug,' Kxpswb Gxpswb vdlg, lq udwkhu d vfruqixo wrqh, 'lw phdqv mxvw zkdw L fkrrvh lw wr phdq — qhlwkhu pruh qru ohvv”. The text is encrypted using the Caesar Cipher technique where each letter is replaced with a different letter a fixed number of places down in the alphabet. Note that the capital letters have not been removed from the encryption. 
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to think about the most common letters in the English language. 
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The most commonly used letter above is H which we can assume corresponds to E in the English language. We now have: 
<p>
"ZkEq L xvE d zrug", Kxpswb Gxpswb vdlg, lq udwkEu d vfruqixo wrqE, "lw pEdqv mxvw zkdw L fkrrvh lw wr pEdq — qElwkhu pruE qru oEvv".
<p>
Now, as we have used a Caesar Cipher encryption, we can count how many letters H is away from E. The answer is 3. This means that all letters in the original text have been replaced with those 3 letters down. Now that we have this information, we can decipher the encryption to get: 
<p>
"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less".
