<h1>Problem ID 30653</h1>
<p>
A pawn stands on one of the squares of an endless in both directions chequered strip of paper. It can be shifted by m squares to the right or by n squares to the left. For which m and n can it move to the next cell to the right?
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The problem can be reduced to the question of the solvability of the equation mx - ny = 1 in natural numbers. Next, see the task 60489.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
For relatively prime m and n.
