<h1>Problem ID 103883</h1>
<p>
On an island, there are knights who always tell the truth, and liars who always lie. The traveller met three of the islanders and asked each of them: '' How many knights are there among your companions? ''. The first one answered: "None." The second one said: '' One ''. What did the third man say?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If the first is a knight, then by virtue of his words, the second and third are liars, which is impossible because of the statement of the second islander. So, the first one is a liar. If the second is a liar, then by his words the third is also a liar, but then the first one told the truth, and he had to lie. So, the second one is a knight. By virtue of his words, the third is also a knight. The third islander will answer honestly: '' One ''.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
The third one said '' One ''.
