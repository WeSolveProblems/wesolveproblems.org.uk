<h1>Problem ID 87963</h1>
<p>
The peasant must transport across a river a wolf, a goat and a cabbage. The boat accommodates one person, and with him/her either a wolf, a goat, or a cabbage. If you leave the goat and the wolf unattended, the wolf will eat the goat. If you leave cabbage and goat without supervision, the goat will eat the cabbage. How can the peasant transport his cargo across the river?
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think about who the peasant can leave unattended.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The peasant cannot leave the wolf with the goat or the goat with the cabbage, but he can leave the cabbage with the wolf. Let's show, on the diagram, what the peasant should do next:

Thus, the peasant, with all his property, will be able to cross to the other side. Think about how the peasant should behave, if at the third crossing he takes with him not the wolf, but the cabbage?
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	The peasant travels to the other shore with the goat and then returns. He goes with the wolf and comes back with the goat. He goes with cabbage and then returns. Finally, he goes with the goat.

<h1>Answer</h1>
