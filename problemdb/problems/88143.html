<h1>Problem ID 88143</h1>
<p>
Find the largest number of which each digit, starting with the third, is equal to the sum of the two previous digits.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Notice that of two numbers, the one with more digits is greater
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
It would seem that this task is very similar to the previous one, but the solution is completely different. The number with more digits in it will be the greater one. And the total number will be greater, the smaller the first two digits. Let's check. If the first digits are 1 and 0, then we get 10112358. If the first digits are 1 and 1, then we get 112358, if 2 and 0, then we get 202246. So, the required number is 10112358.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
10112358.
