<h1>Problem ID 116657</h1>
<p>
In the equality TIME + TICK = SPIT, replace the same letters with the same numbers, and different letters with different digits so that the word TICK is as small as possible $($ there are no zeros among the digits $)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
So that TICK is as small as possible, you must first make the number representing the letter T as small as possible, then - the number I, then - the number of C, and then - K.
Let's try to take T = 1. Then S is 2 or 3. Then if S = 3, then I is no less than 5, and if S = 2, then we can take I = 3. We take C = 4, K = 5 $($ in this case, TICK has the minimum possible value $)$ and try to pick up the remaining numbers. From the equality 13ME + 1345 = 2P31, we obtain that
E = 6, M = 8, P = 7.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
1386 + 1345 = 2731.
