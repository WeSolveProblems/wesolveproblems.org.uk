<h1>Problem ID 65304</h1>
<p>
James furiously cuts a rectangular sheet of paper with scissors. Every second he cuts a random piece by an unsystematic rectilinear cut into two parts.
<p>
a)	Find the mathematical expectation of the number of sides of a polygon $($made from a piece of paper$)$ that James randomly picks up after an hour of such work.
<p>
  b) Solve the same problem if at first the piece of paper had the form of an arbitrary polygon.

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
a)	Nothing to translate. 
<p>
  b) Suppose that, as a result of James’ activity, there is a k + 1 polygon on the table, including $p_3$ triangles, $p_4$ quadrangles, ..., $p_m$ m-gons $($m is the largest possible number of sides for the resulting polygon$)$. Then the mathematical expectation of the number of sides of the selected polygon is $1/(k + 1) (3p_3 + 4p_4 + ... + mp_m)$.
  In parentheses, we have the total number of sides of all of the obtained polygons.
<p>
  Suppose that James had an n-gon. The probability of making a random cut through exactly one vertex is zero. Hence, each cut divides some two sides of the cut polygon into two parts, and two new sides are obtained along the cut. Thus, each cut adds 4 new sides. After k cuts, the total number of sides will be n + 4k.

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
a) 4; b) $\frac {n+14400}{3601}$ where n is the number of sides of the original polygon.

</p> 
<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
1.	If the original polygon had a number of sides of n, which is much less than 3600, then μ ≈ 4.

2. This problem, in a different formulation and in a more general form, was invented and solved by the academician Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov. Sakharov wrote that the problem arose when he chopped cabbage.
