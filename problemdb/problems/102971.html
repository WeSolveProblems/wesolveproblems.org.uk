<h1>Problem ID 102971</h1>
<p>
Two boys had two square cakes. Each made two straight cuts on his cake from edge to edge. In this case, one ended up with three pieces, and the other with four. How could this be?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note that the cuts may cross.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
This could happen if, in the first case, the cuts did not intersect, and in the second case they crossed. For example, if in the first case they were parallel to each other, and in the second - perpendicular.
