<h1>Problem ID 35476</h1>
<p>
Let f $($x$)$ be a polynomial about which it is known that the equation f $($x$)$ = x has no roots. Prove that then the equation f $($f $($x$)$)$ = x does not have any roots.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1> 
<p>
Derive from the condition that either f $($x$)$ $>$ x for any x, or f $($x$)$ $<$x for any x.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
It follows from the condition that the equation f $($x$)$ - x = 0 has no solutions. Since f $($x$)$ - x is a continuous function, it is either positive everywhere or negative everywhere, otherwise it would take the value 0 at some point $($by the intermediate value theorem$)$. Let f $($x$)$ - x be positive everywhere. This means that for any x the inequality f $($x$)$ $>$ x holds. Let f $($x$)$ = y. Then f $($f $($x$)$)$ = f $($y$)$ $>$ y = f $($x$)$ $>$ x. Thus, for any x f $($f $($x$)$)$ - x $>$ 0, that is, the equation f $($f $($x$)$)$ = x has no roots. In a similar way, we show that the equation f $($f $($x$)$)$ = x does not have any roots, even in the case when f $($x$)$ $<$ x holds for any x.
