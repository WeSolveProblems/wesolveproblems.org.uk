<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  There are $2k+1$ cards, numbered with the numbers $1$ to $2k+1$. What is the largest number of cards that can be chosen, so that no number on a chosen card  is equal to the sum of two numbers from two other chosen cards?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If we take all of the cards with odd numbers on them (of which there are $k+1$ the condition will be fulfilled). If we take $k+2$ cards, and subtract all of the other numbers from the largest number $N$, we will get $k+1$ different values. All of the remaining numbers cannot exceed $2k$, therefore at least two of them will coincide with the numbers on the $k+2$ chosen cards. At least one of these two will not be equal to $ \frac{N}{2}$.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  $k+1$ cards.
