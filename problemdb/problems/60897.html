<h1>Problem ID 60897</h1>
<p>
There are 4 weights and scales. How many loads that are different by weight can be accurately weighed using these weights, if
<p>
a)	weights can be placed only on one side of the scales;
<p>
  b) weights can be placed on both sides of the scales?


</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a)	Nothing to translate.
<p>
b) The weights can be separated into 3 piles in $3^4$ = 81 ways $($see problem number 60348$)$. The first pile will be put aside, and the other two we put on the scales $($if both of these piles are empty, then discard them$)$. Since it does not matter which sides of the scales these loads are placed on, 80 should be divided in half.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a)	$2^4$ - 1 = 15; b) 40 loads.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
	It is assumed that the weight of the weights is such that to each two loads there correspond different differences among the weights. For example, a set of weights with weights 1, 2, 3, 4 allows you to weigh only 10 loads.
