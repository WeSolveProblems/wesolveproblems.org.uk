<h1>Problem ID 78653</h1> <p>
	How can you connect 50 cities with the least number of airlines so that from every city you can get to any other one by making no more than two transfers?


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
   Let's single out one city and connect it with an airline with each of the other 49 cities. This will require 49 airlines.
<p>
   A smaller number of airlines cannot do. Indeed, according to problem number 31098 d) there are at least 49 edges in a connected graph with 50 vertices.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
