<h1>Problem ID 32794</h1>
<p>
$($Continuation of problem number 32792$)$
<p>
The state of Dipolia is inhabited by liars and knights. Liars always lie, and knights always tell the truth. A traveller who travelled through this state met four people and asked them: "Who are you?". He received the following answers:
<p>
1st: "We are all liars."
<p>
2nd: "Among us is a liar."
<p>
3rd: "Among us are two liars."
<p>

4th: "I have never lied and I'm not lying".
<p>

The traveller quickly realised who the fourth resident was. How did he do it?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Suppose that the fourth resident is a liar. Note that the first resident is also a liar, since otherwise he will contradict his own words. Hence, there are at least two liars among them, therefore, the second inhabitant is also a liar; but then the third resident is a liar, that is, the first resident told the truth, but he, as we have already decided, is a liar so this is a contradiction. So, the fourth inhabitant is a knight.
