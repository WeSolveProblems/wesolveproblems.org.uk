<h1>Problem ID 65260</h1>
<p>
Louis performs in the USE test in mathematics. The exam consists of three types of assignments: A, B, and C. For each of the tasks of type A, four choices are given, only one of which is correct. There are 10 of such tasks. Tasks of type B and C require a written answer. Since Louis constantly skipped lessons, his knowledge in mathematics is shallow. Assignments of type A he performs by choosing answers at random. The first of the tasks of type B Louis solves correctly with a probability of 1/3. Louis can do no more questions. For the correct answer to one question of type A, 1 point is given, for tasks of type B - 2 points. How likely is it that Louis will score more than 5 points?
<p>
Take the tasks of type A from the trial version of the USE in 2008 $($http://ege.edu.ru/demo/math.zip$)$ and conduct the random selection experiment 10 times. Compare the result with the theoretical result $($for 5 correct answers$)$. Make sure the results don’t differ by much.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Event $A_n$ = {Louis receives n points or more for assignments of type A}.
<p>
Event B = {He solves a problem of type B}.
<p>
Then P $(${Louis received more than 5 points}$)$ =

The probability of correctly guessing one of the 4 solutions of a particular problem of type A is ¼. According to the Bernoulli distribution law

Therefore, P{Louis received more than 5 points} = $1/3 P(A_4) + 2/3 P(A_6)$ =
