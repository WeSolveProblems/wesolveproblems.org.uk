<h1>Problem ID 116665</h1>
<p>
Four children said the following about each other.
<br>
<i>Mary</i>: Sarah, Nathan and George solved the problem.
<br>
<i>Sarah</i>: Mary, Nathan and George didn't solve the problem.
<br>
<i>Nathan</i>: Mary and Sarah lied.
<br>
<i>George</i>: Mary, Sarah and Nathan told the truth.
<br>
How many of the children actually told the truth?
</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Mary's and Sarah's statements contradict each other, and it follows that George definitely lied. Then we have two possible cases.
<br>
1) Nathan told the truth. Then Mary and Sarah also lied, so then only one child told the truth, i.e. Nathan.
<br>
2) Nathan lied. Then either Mary or Sarah told the truth. Then in this case we also have that only one child told the truth.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
One child.
