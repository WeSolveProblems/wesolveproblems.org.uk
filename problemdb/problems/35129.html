<h1>Problem ID 35129</h1> <p>
Three people play table tennis, and the player who lost the game gives way to the player who did not participate in it. As a result, it turned out that the first player played 10 games and the second played 21 games. How many games did the third player play?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
The first player plays the rarest every second game.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
By the condition of the problem, the second player played 21 games, so at least 21 games were played. Of every two games in a row, the first player must participate in at least one, so there were not more than 2 Â· 10 + 1 = 21 games. Therefore, only 21 games were played, and the second player participated in each of them. In 10 games he played against the first player, and the remaining 11 games with the third player. 

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
11 games.
