<h1>Problem</h1>
10 school students took part in a Mathematical Olympiad and solved 35 problems in total. It is known that within this group of school students there are students who solved exactly one problem, students who solved exactly two problems and students who solved exactly three problems. Prove that there is a student who solved exactly 5 problems.

<h1>Solution</h1>
It follows from the parameters given that 3 of the students solved 6 problems between them. This means the other 7 students solved $35-6=29$ problems between them. Since $29=4 \times 7 +1$ there must be at least one student who solved 5 problems
