<h1>Problem ID 65278</h1>
<p>
Kate and Gina agreed to meet at the underground in the first hour of the afternoon. Kate comes to the meeting place between noon and one o'clock in the afternoon, waits for 10 minutes and then leaves. Gina does the same.
<p>
a)	What is the probability that they will meet?
<p>
b)	How will the probability of a meeting change if Gina decides to come earlier than half past twelve, and Kate still decides to come between noon and one o'clock?
<p>
  c) How will the probability of a meeting change if Gina decides to come at an arbitrary time between 12:00 and 12:50, and Kate still comes between 12:00 and 13:00?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
a)	Let's denote the times of arrival graphically. The time of arrival of Gina is plotted along the x-axis, and the arrival time of Kate is plotted along the y-axis.

<p>
  The figure, outlined in black, is the set of those times of the arrival of both, under which they will meet. The probability is equal to the ratio of the times of arrival, which satisfy the condition of meeting, to the set of possible arrival times. Thus, it is necessary to divide the area of the selected part by the area of a $6 \times 6$ square.
<p>
b)	We denote graphically the arrival times, as in point a). In this case, the possible arrival time of Gina will be in the range from 0 to 30 minutes. The area of the selected figure refers to the area of the whole $6 \times 3$ figure as 5.5/18 = 11/36. Thus, the probability remains unchanged.

<p>
  c) The figure corresponding to the new condition shows that the probability is 9.5/30 = 19/60$>$ 11/36.


</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
a)	11/36; b) 11/36; c) 19/60.
