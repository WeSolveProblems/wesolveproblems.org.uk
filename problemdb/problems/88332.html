<h1>Problem ID 88332</h1>
<p>
Burbot-Liman. Find the numbers that, when substituted for letters instead of the letters in the expression NALIM × 4 = LIMAN, fulfill the given equality $($ different letters correspond to different numbers, but identical letters correspond to identical numbers $)$
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Because $4 \times M$ is even, then H is an even number. Then H = 2, because otherwise the product on the left would give a six-digit number. Therefore, A = 8 or A = 9, and M = 3 or M = 8. Since the product on the left gives a five-digit number, then A $≤$ 4.
Let M = 3. Since $4 \times H$ + 1 ends in A, then A is odd, that is, A = 1, then H = 5, but then A = 8 or A = 9 do not fit.
Let M = 8, and then A = 8; the number $4 \times I$ + 3 ends in a A, then A is an odd number, i.e. A = 1 or A = 3. If A = 1, then A is not equal to 9. Consequently, A = 3, and H = 5.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
$23958 \times 4$ = 95832.
