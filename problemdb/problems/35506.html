<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Is it possible to fill an nxn table with the numbers $-1, 0, 1$ such that the sums of all the rows, columns and diagonals are unique?</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>How many sums are there? How many possible values for the sum are there?</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  The question requires that the value of $2n+2$ sums ($n$ rows, $n$ columns and two diagonals) are different from one another. Each of these sums consists of $n$ terms, with the values $-1, 0, 1$ . Therefore each of the sums has an integer value between $-n$ and $n$ . Therefore the total number of possible values for the sum is $2n+1$ Since $2n+1 < 2n+2$ at least two sums will have tha same value.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>No.</p>
