<h1>Problem</h1>
At the end of the month 5 workers were paid £1500 between them. Each one wants to buy themselves a smartphone that costs £320. Prove that one of them will have to wait another month in order to do so.
<h1>Solution</h1>
If each one of them bought a smartphone, the total cost would be $5\times320= 1600$ which is greater than £1500
