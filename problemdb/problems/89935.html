<h1>Problem ID 89935</h1>
<p>
On an island, there are knights who always tell the truth, and liars who always lie. What question would you need to ask the islander to find out if he has a crocodile at home?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Pay attention, if a liar is forced to repeat his answer, then it will already be true.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
   It is enough to ask, for example, "What would you say to me a minute ago if I asked if you have a green crocodile at home?". When answering such a question, the knight truthfully replies the true answer, and the liar lies, retelling the false answer, i.e. he will answer with the truth.
