<p>
Multiplication of numbers. Restore the following example of the multiplication of natural numbers if it is known that the sum of the digits of both factors is the same.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Pay attention to the last phrase. We rewrite the example in the following form

Obviously, $x_4$ = $x_8$ = $x_{15}$, $x_{11}$ = 2. In addition, it is clear that $x_1$ = 1 or $x_1$ = 2, otherwise $2x_1$ is greater than 5, which contradicts the condition.
1$)$ Let $x_1$ = 1, then $x_9$ = 2, $x_5$ = 3, then the doubled multiplier is in the range of 3402 to 3492, or the multiplier is between 1701 and 1746. Let's check three possible options, given that the sum of the digits for both factors is the same. 1701 × 27, 1711 × 28, 1721 × 29 shows us that no option is suitable.
2$)$ Let $x_1$ = 2. Then $x_9$ = 4, $x_5$ = 1, $x_2$ = 2, with $x_6$ $≤$ 5, otherwise $x_6$ + 4 $>$ 9, which contradicts the hypothesis, but then 5 $≤$ $x_4$ $≤$ 7. Checking the three possible variants 2221 × 25, 2231 × 26, 2241 × 27, we find that only the second case is suitable.
