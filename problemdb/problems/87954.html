<h1>Problem ID 87954</h1>
<p>
What is the maximum number of pieces that a round pancake can be divided into with three straight cuts?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Remember task 11.
</p>

<h1>Decision</h1>
<p>
If out of three straight lines every two intersect inside the pancake, you will get 7 pieces $($see Figure 11.4$)$. If from these straight lines two are parallel or intersect outside the pancake, then the number of pieces will be lower.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
7 pieces.
</p>
