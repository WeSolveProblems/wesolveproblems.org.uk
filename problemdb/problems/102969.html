<h1>Problem ID 102969</h1>
<p>
 The evil stepmother, leaving for the ball, gave Cinderella a bag in which rice and cous-cous were mixed, and ordered for them to be sorted. When Cinderella was leaving for the ball, she left three bags: one was rice, the other - cous-cous, and in the third - not yet disassembled mixture. In order not to confuse the bags, Cinderella attached to each of them a sign saying: "Rice", "Cous-cous" and "Mixture".
The stepmother returned from the ball first and deliberately swapped all the signs in such a way that on every sack there was an incorrect sign. The Fairy Godmother managed to warn Cinderella that now no sign on bags is true. Then Cinderella took out only one single grain from one sack and, looking at it, immediately guessed what that mixture was. How did she do it?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Think about whether it is possible to take a grain of rice from a bag on which "rice" is written.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
It is necessary to take a grain from that bag, on which the word "mixture" is written. There can not be a mixture in it, it means that it contains exactly the grains that we will get from there. For definiteness, let the rice lie in this bag. $($This assumption is also made for the convenience of presentation, however, as an exercise, try to repeat all the arguments for the case when the sack with the sign "Mixture" contains cous-cous.$)$
So, in a bag with the sign "Mixture" lies rice. This means that in the bag with the sign "rice", only cous-cous can lie $($if there were a mixture, then in the bag with the sign "cous-cous" there would be sign, which is impossible$)$. It immediately follows that in the bag with the sign "cous-cous" there is a mixture.
