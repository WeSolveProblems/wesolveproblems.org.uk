<h1>Problem ID 64305</h1>
<p>
 Author: D.E. Shnol
<p>
On the island of Truthland, all of the inhabitants may be mistaken, but the younger ones never contradict the elders, and when the older ones contradict the younger ones, they $($the elders$)$ are not mistaken. Between the residents A, B and C there was such a conversation:
<p>
  A: B is the tallest.
<p>
  B: A is the tallest.
<p>
  C: I'm taller than B.
<p>
Does it follow from this conversation that the younger the person, the taller he or she is $($for the three people having this conversation$)$?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Both B and C contradict A. Therefore, they are older than A, that is, A is the youngest. When the elders contradict the younger ones, they are not mistaken, it means that indeed, A is the tallest, and C is taller than B, that is, B is the shortest. But who is older, B or C, we cannot learn this from this conversation $($they do not contradict each other$)$. It could also be that the shortest B could be the middle one in age, that is, neither the youngest nor the oldest. 

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
It does not follow.
