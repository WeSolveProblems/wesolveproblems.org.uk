<h1>Problem ID 35457</h1>
<p>
Prove that the equation $ a_1 \sin x + b_1 \cos x + a_2 \sin 2x + b_2 \cos 2x + … + a_n \sin nx + b_n \cos nx = 0 $ has at least one root for any values of $ a_1 , b_1, a_2, b_2, …, a_n, b_n $.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
The left-hand side is a periodic function with period $ 2 \pi $; what is the mean value of the left-hand side on the segment $ [0; 2 \pi] $?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We denote the left-hand side of the equation by f $($x$)$. Suppose that the equation $f (x) = 0$ has no </p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> s. $f (x)$ is a continuous function that is periodic with period $ 2 \pi $. We consider the function $f (x)$ on the interval $ [0; 2 \pi] $. If on this interval there were two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $f (x_1)> 0$ and $f (x_2) $<$0$, then by the property of continuous functions between points $x_1$ and $x_2$ there would be a point z such that $f (z) = 0$. Thus, in this case we get a contradiction with our assumption. Thus, on the interval $ [0; 2 \pi] $ the function $f (x)$ is either positive or negative everywhere. In any case, the integral of the function $f (x)$, computed on the interval $ [0; 2 \pi] $, will not be 0. On the other hand, this integral is equal to zero, since for each of the summands $ a_1 \sin x, b_1 \cos x, a_2 \sin 2x, b_2 \cos 2x, …, a_n \sin nx, b_n \cos nx $ is an integral over the interval $ [0; 2 \pi] $ is 0. Thus, a contradiction is obtained from which the statement of the problem follows.
