<h1>Problem ID 35430</h1>
<p>
Given a board (divided into squares) of the size: a) 10x12, b) 9x10, c) 9x11, consider the game with two players where: in one turn a player is allowed to cross out any row or any column if there is at least one square not crossed out. The loser is the one who cannot make a move. Is there a winning strategy for one of the players?

</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Keep track of the parity (whether it is even or not) of the number of rows and columns.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<br>
c) A strategy for the second player: after the first player's first turn, make the board be 8x10 (if the first player crosses out a row, then te second player crosses out a column and vice versa). Then proceed to play using the strategy from a).
</p>
