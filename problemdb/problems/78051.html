<h1>Problem ID 78051</h1>
<p>
The numbers [a], [2a], ..., [Na] are all different, and the numbers [1/a], [2/a], …, [M/a] are also all different. Find all such a.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The answer is: $(N-1)$/N $\leq$ | a | $\leq$ M/$(M-1)$ The numbers [x] and [y] are different if and only if the numbers [- x] and [- y] are different. Therefore, it is sufficient to consider the case when a $>$ 0. If a $<$ $(N-1)$/N, then among the numbers [a], [2a], ..., [Na] there are ones that coincide, since these N numbers are contained among the N - 1 numbers 0, 1, ..., N - 2. Therefore, a $\geq$ $(N-1)$/N. The same arguments for the number 1 / a show that 1/a $\geq$ $(M-1)$/M, i.e. a $\leq$ M/$(M-1)$. Let us show that if $(N-1)$/N $\leq$ a $\leq$ M/$(M-1)$ then all the numbers [a], [ 2a], ..., [Na] are different. Indeed, if a $\geq$ 1, then in general all the numbers [a], [2a], [3a], ... are different, and if a $<$ 1, then 1 - 1/N $\leq$ a $\leq$ a $<$ 1, 2 - 2/N $\leq$ 2a $<$ 2, …, N-1 $\leq$ Na $<$ N, therefore [ka] = k - 1 for k = 1, 2, ..., N. For the numbers [1/a], [2/a], …, [M/a] the reasoning is similar.
