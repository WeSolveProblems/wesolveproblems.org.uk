<h1>Problem ID 78535</h1>
<p>
Two players play on a square field of size 99 × 99, which has been split onto cells of size 1 × 1. The first player places a cross on the center of the field; After this, the second player can place a zero on any of the eight cells surrounding the cross of the first player. After that, the first puts a cross onto any cell of the field next to one of those already occupied, etc. The first player wins if he can put a cross on any corner cell. Prove that with any strategy of the second player the first can always win.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let the first player, starting with their second turn, make moves symmetric to the moves of the second player relative to the center of the field. Then, as soon as the second player takes one of the corner cells, the first one can occupy the opposite corner cell.
