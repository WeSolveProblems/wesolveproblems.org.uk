<h1>Problem ID 65547</h1>
<p>
  A box contains 111 red, blue, green, and white marbles. It is known that if we remove 100 marbles from the box, without looking, we will always have removed at least one marble of each colour. What is the minimum number of marbles we need to remove to guarantee that we have removed marbles of 3 different colours?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  There are no fewer than 12 marbles of each colour, as otherwise all the marbles of one colour could be in the 11 marbles left in the box.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore of two colours there are no more than $111-24=87$ marbles. Hence in any 88 marbles removed from the box there will always be at least three colours present.
</p>
<p>
  87 marbles is insufficient, for example for the distribution of colours 75, 12, 12, 12.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  88 marbles.
