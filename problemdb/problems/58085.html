<h1>Problem ID 58085</h1>
<p>
  A unit square contains 51 points. Prove that it is always possible to cover three of them with a circle of radius $\frac{1}{7}$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Divide the given unit square into 25 identical smaller squares of side 0.2. One of these must contain at least three points. A circle that completely encloses this smaller square will have a radius of $\frac{1}{5} sqrt{2} < \frac{1}{7}$, therefore the smaller square can be completely enclosed in a circle of radius $\frac{1}{7}$.
