<h1>Problem ID 87969</h1>
<p>
The old shoemaker Carl sewed some boots and sent his son Hans to the market to sell them for £25. Two disabled people came to the boy's market stall $($one without a left leg, the other without a right one$)$ and was asked to sell each of them a boot. Hans agreed and sold each boot for £12.50.
<p>
When the boy came home and told the whole story to his father, Carl decided that his son should have sold the boots to the disabled buyers for less - each for £10. He gave Hans £5 and ordered him to return £2.50 to each disabled buyer.
<p>
While the boy was looking for the disabled people at the market, he saw that someone was selling sweets and as could not resist, spent £3 on sweets. After that, he found the disabled buyers and gave them the remaining money - each got £1. Returning home, Hans realised how badly he had acted. He told his father and asked for forgiveness. The shoemaker was very angry and punished his son by sending him to his room.
<p>
Sitting in his room, Hans thought about the day’s events. It turned out that since he returned £1 to each buyer, they paid £11.50 for each boot: 12.50 - 1 = 11.50. So, the boots cost £23: $2 \times 11.50$ = 23. And Hans spent £3 on sweets, therefore, it total, there were £26: 23 + 3 = 26. But there were only £25! Where did the extra pound come from?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Think about how much money Carl should have received, how much he did receive and why.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The buyers paid £23 for the boots, but Carl received only £20 from them, as Hans spent the remaining £3 on sweets. Hans, sitting in his room, added revenue $($£23$)$ and costs $($£3$)$. This summation does not make any sense. And another thing, if he had calculated the difference between cost and revenue then he would get the "net" income, i.e. that same £20 which Carl eventually got.
