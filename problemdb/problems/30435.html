<h1>Problem ID 30435</h1>
<p>
Numbers from 1 to 20 are written in a row. Players take turns placing pluses and minuses between these numbers. After all of the gaps are filled, the result is calculated. If it is even, then the first player wins, if it is odd, then the second player wins. Who won?</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The evenness of the result does not depend on the arrangement of pluses and minuses, but depends only on the number of odd numbers in the initial set. Since in this case there are 10 of them $($that is, an even number$)$, then the first player wins.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
The first player.
