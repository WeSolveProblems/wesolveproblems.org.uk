<h1>Problem ID 116063</h1>
<p>
<p>
Find all the solutions of the puzzle R + OH + OH + OH + OH + OH + OH + OH + OH = WE.
$($The same letters correspond to the same numbers, whereas different letters correspond to different numbers$)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Since $8 \times OH$ $<$ 100, then OH $\leq$ 12, that is, O = 1, and H = 0 or 2. But H can not be 0, since then H and N would be the same digit. Therefore, H = 2. Thus, $8 \times OH$ = $8 \times 12$ = 96, which means that the WE can be equal to 96, 97 or 98. The last two cases are not suitable, since then R is equal to 1 or 2, and these digits are already being used. Hence, WE = 9, and H = 0.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
0 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 96.
