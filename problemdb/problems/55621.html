<h1>Problem ID 55621</h1>
<p>
A rectangular billiard with sides 1 and $ \sqrt {2} $ is given. From its angle at an angle of 45 Â° to the side a ball is released. Will it ever get into one of the pockets? $($The pockets are in the corners of the billiard table$)$.


</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
With each collision of the ball against the wall, we will reflect the billiard table relative to this wall.


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
With each collision of the ball with the wall, we will reflect the billiard table relative to this wall. Thus, the ball will always move along a straight line along the "chequered paper", the cells of which are billiard tables, and will never get into the node of the cell, $($since 1 and $ \sqrt {2} $ are incommensurable$)$, i.e. it will never fall into one of the pockets.


</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
No, it will not.
