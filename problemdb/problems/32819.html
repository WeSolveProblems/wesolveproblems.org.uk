<h1>Problem ID 32819</h1>
<p>
Vincent makes small weights. He made 4 weights which should have masses (in grams) of 1, 3, 4 and 7, respectively. However, he made a mistake and one of these weights has the wrong mass. By weighing them twice using balance scales (without the use of weights other than those mentioned) can he find which weight has the wrong mass?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let us refer to the weights as 1, 3, 4 and 7 depending on how much they are meant to weigh. First we shall put the 1 and 3 weights in one of the cups of the balance scale and the 4 weight in the other cup. In the second weighing we will place the 3 and 4 weights in one cup and the 7 weight in the other cup.
<br>
If during one of the weighings the cups are balanced (i.e. the contents weigh the same) this means that the "wrong" weight is not one of those being weighed. If the same cup weighs more in both of the weighings, then the wrong weight is 3. Otherwise, the wrong weight is 4.
