<h1>Problem ID 65311</h1>
<p>
 A correct dice is thrown many times. It is known that at some point the total amount of points became equal to exactly 2010.
Find the mathematical expectation of the number of throws made to this point.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  The first way. Let the event $A_n$ be "the sum of the points is equal to n", and $X_n$ be the number of throws made. The event $A_n$ we consider to be already realised, and we are interested in waiting for $EX_n$. Let $I_k$ be equal to 1 if the first throw gave k points, and 0 otherwise.
<p>
  Events $B_k$ "the first throw gave k points" and $A_{n-k}$ $($for the remaining throws$)$ refer to different throws and are therefore independent. Consequently, the conditional probability of the event $(I_k = 1)$ is <IMG SRC="65311 1.gif">
<p>
  It is clear that $X_n = X_{n-1}I_1 + X_{n-2}I_2 + ... + X_{n-6}I_6 + 1$.
<p>
  In this case, the random variables $X_{n-}k$ and $I_k$ are independent, since they refer to different series of throws. Therefore, <IMG SRC="65311 2.gif">
<p>
  Introducing the notation $EX_k = e_k$ and $P (A_k) = p_k$, we obtain: <IMG SRC="65311 3.gif"> $($1$)$
<p>
  It remains to use the fact that $6p_n = p_{n-1} + ... + p_{n-6}$. This follows, for example, from the fact that the sum of the probabilities $P (I_k = 1)$ is equal to one. Hence, <IMG SRC="65311 4.gif">
<p>
  The initial values are: $p_{-5} = p_{-4} = ... = p^{-1} = 0; p_0 = 1; e_{-5} = e_{-4} = ... = e_0 = 0$. A sequential calculation yields $e_1 = 1, p_1 = 1/6$;

$e_{2010}$ = 574,5238095 ...

  The second way. It is known that the sum of the points is equal to n. Let the event $A_k$ "at some point the sum is equal to k" occur. Then the subsequent throws should lead to the event $A_{n-k}$. Hence <IMG SRC="65311 6.gif"> $($the events $A_{n-k}$ and $A_k$ refer to different series of throws and are therefore independent$)$.
<p>
  Let's consider the value of $J_k$, which is 1 if the sum is at some time equal to k, and 0 otherwise.
<p>
  Obviously, the random quantity "the number of sums obtained" $X_n = J_1 + J_2 + ... + J_n$ is equal to the number of shots made.
<p>
  We introduce brief notations $EX_k = e_k, P (A_k) = p_k$. The expectation of $EJ_k$ is, <IMG SRC="65311 7.gif"> therefore, <IMG SRC="65311 8.gif">
<p>
  Using the relation $p_{n-k}$ = $1/6 (p_{n-k-1} + ... + p_{n-k-6})$, we write the expectation differently: <IMG SRC="65311 9.gif">
