<h1>Problem ID 89953</h1>
<p>
In a vase, there is a bouquet of 7 white and blue lilac branches. It is known that 1$)$ at least one branch is white, 2$)$ out of any two branches, at least one is blue. How many white branches and how many blue are there in the bouquet?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think about the number of white branches.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
It follows from the first condition that at least one white branch is present. From the second condition, it follows that there is only one white branch: indeed, if there were at least two of them, then, taking these two branches, we would get a pair in which there is no blue branch, i.e. Condition 2 is not satisfied. From here we immediately get that there is one white branch, and the other six are blue.
