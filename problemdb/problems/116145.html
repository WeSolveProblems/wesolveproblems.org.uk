<h1>Problem ID 116145</h1>
<p>
Of the four inequalities 2x. $>$ 70, x $<$ 100, 4x $>$ 25 and x $>$ 5, two are true and two are false. Find the value of x if it is known that it is an integer.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Given that x is an integer, the inequalities can be rewritten as x $>$ 35, x $<$ 100, x $>$ 6, and x $>$ 5. If x $<$ 100, then the other three inequalities are true, which contradicts the condition. Hence, from the three inequalities: x $>$ 5, x $>$ 6 and x $>$ 35 - one is true and two are incorrect.
Since the first two follow from the third inequality, and the first also follows from the second, then one option remains: the first inequality is true, and the other two are not. Thus, 5 $<$ x $\leq$ 6, that is, x = 6.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
x = 6.
