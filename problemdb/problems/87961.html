<h1>Problem ID 87961</h1>
<p>
Fred and George together with their mother were decorating the Christmas tree. So that they would not fight, their mother gave each brother the same number of decorations and branches. Fred tried to hang one decoration on each branch, but he needed one more branch for his last decoration. George tried to hang two toys on each branch, but one branch was empty. What do you think, how many branches and how many decorations did the mother give to her sons?
<p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to act like Fred - hang one decoration on each branch. 
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let's try to act like Fred - we'll hang one decoration on each branch, then one extra decoration will remain. Now take two decorations â€“ the one that is left over, and the other one which we remove from one of the branches. If now these decorations are hung on those branches on which the decorations from the first time remain, then on two branches there will be decorations and one branch will remain empty. If, in addition to these three branches, there would be more branches, then on these "extra" branches there would be one decoration, which contradicts the condition. Thus, there were 3 branches, and 4 decorations. 

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
3 branches, 4 decorations.
