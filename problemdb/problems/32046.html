<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>You are given 25 numbers. The sum of any 4 of these numbers is positive. Prove that the sum of all 25 numbers is also positive.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<h2> Solution 1 </h2>
<p>Amongst the given numbers there must be at least one positive number (if all 25 numbers were negative, then their sum would also be negative which would contradict the conditions given). In fact, in a similar way we can prove that no fewer than 22 of the numbers in the group must be positive - but for the proof we need only one such number. Take this number and place it to one side. Consider the 24 remaining numbers. Split these into groups of 4 at random. All of these groups must be positive by definition. The sum of all 25 numbers is equal to the sum of all of the groups and the single known positive number. Therefore, since the sums of all 4 groups and the positive term is positive, the sum of all 25 numbers must also be positive.</p>
<h2> Solution 2 </h2>
<p>If the sum of any 4 of the numbers is positive, then the sum of any 24 numbers must also be positive. There are only 25 combinations of 24 numbers. If we sum all 25 combinations, we get $24 \times$ the sum of all 25 numbers (each number is excluded from the group of 24 only once, so occurs in the sum 24 times), which is greater than 0. It follows therefore that the sum itself is also greater than 0.</p>
