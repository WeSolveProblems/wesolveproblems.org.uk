<h1>Problem ID 65350</h1>
<p>
Find the probability that heads will fall an even number of times, in an experiment in which:
<p>
a)	a symmetrical coin is thrown n times;
<p>
  b) a coin is thrown n times, for which the probability of getting heads in one throw is $p(0 <p <1)$.

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1>
 <p>
  The probability that heads will fall exactly k times, as is known, is equal to <img src="65350 1.png">
where q = 1 - p is the probability of a tails falling out. Therefore, the event "getting heads an even number of times" has a probability <img src="65350 2.png">

<p>
where k is the largest even number not exceeding n.
<p>
  In addition to this event is the event "getting heads an odd number of times." The probability of this is obtained similarly to the replacement of even indices and powers by odd ones:

<p>
 where m is the largest odd number, not exceeding n. The difference between these probabilities is:

 = $(q - p)^n$.
<p>
  On the other hand, $P_2 + P_1$ = 1. From the resulting system of equations, we find that:

<p>
  In particular, for a symmetrical coin p = 0.5, therefore $P_2$ = 0.5.

</p>
