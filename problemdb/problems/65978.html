<h1>Problem ID 65978</h1>
<p>
A pharmacist has three weights, with which he measured out and gave 100 g of iodine to one buyer, 101 g of honey to another, and 102 g of hydrogen peroxide to the third. He always placed the weights on one side of the scales, and the goods on the other. Could it be that each weight used is lighter than 90 grams?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suitable weightings could be carried out with the weights of 49.5 g, 50.5 g and 51.5 g.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes it could.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. Let us prove that this example is unique.
None of the weightings involved exactly one weight: otherwise its weight would be greater than 90 g. If all three weights were involved in some weighing, then this could only be the third weighing, that is, the sum of the weights of all the weights is 102 g. Then, so that the pharmacist can get 100 g and 101 g, one of the weights must weigh 1 g, and the other is 2 g. Hence, the remaining weight weighs 99 g, which does not suit us.
Therefore, in each weighing, exactly two weights were used, each time different ones. Hence, the doubled weight of all the weights is equal to 100 + 101 + 102 = 303 g, that is, the sum of the weights of three weights is 151.5 g. Therefore, the weight of the lightest weight is 151.5 - 102 = 49.5 g, the weight of the next -
151.5 - 101 = 50.5 g, and the weight of the heaviest - 151.5 - 100 = 51.5 g.
