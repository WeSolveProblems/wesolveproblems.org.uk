<h1>Problem ID 32790</h1>
<p>
It is known that among the members of the government of Limonia $($and there are 20 members in all$)$ there is at least one honest one, and also that from any two at least one is a bribe taker. How many bribe takers are there in the government?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let us note that in the government of Limonia there is exactly one honest official. Indeed, by the condition of the problem, there is one honest official; but there cannot be two honest officials there - then amongst them there would not be a single bribe taker, which contradicts the condition. So, there is exactly one honest official in the government, and therefore, there are 19 bribe takers.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
There are 19 bribe takers in the government.
