<h1>Problem ID 35079</h1>
<p>
Prove that the infinite decimal 0.1234567891011121314 ... $($after the decimal point, all of the natural numbers are written out in order$)$ is an irrational number.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Rational numbers are expressed in periodic decimals. Suppose that our fraction is periodic: some sequence T consisting of n digits is the fraction period beginning with the m-th decimal place. Among the digits after the m-th character there are non-zero ones, therefore, in the sequence of digits T there is a non-zero digit. This means that, starting with the m-th digit after the decimal point, there is a non-zero digit among any n digits in a row. However, in the decimal notation of this fraction there should be a decimal notation of the number $10^k$, where k is greater than m and n. This entry will appear to the right of the m-th digit and contains more than n zeros in a row. This is a contradiction.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
