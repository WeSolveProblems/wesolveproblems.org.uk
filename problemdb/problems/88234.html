<h1>Problem ID 88234</h1>
<p>
In the first pencil case, there is a lilac pen, a green pencil and a red eraser; in the second - a blue pen, a green pencil and a yellow eraser; in the third - a lilac pen, an orange pencil and a yellow eraser. The contents of these pencil cases are characterised by such a pattern: in every two of them exactly one pair of objects coincides in colour and purpose. What should lie in the fourth pencil case, so that this pattern is preserved? $($In each pencil case, there are exactly three objects: a pen, a pencil and an eraser$)$.
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
Think about whether there can be a lilac pen in the fourth pencil case.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The fourth pencil case should contain objects that already occur in the first three pencil cases, but only once.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
Blue pen, orange pencil, red eraser.
