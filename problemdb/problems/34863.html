<h1>Problem ID 34863</h1>
<p>
Two people play the following game. Each player in turn rubs out 9 numbers $($at his choice$)$ from the sequence 1,2, ..., 100,101. After eleven such deletions, 2 numbers will remain. The first player is awarded so many points, as is the difference between these remaining numbers. Prove that the first player can always score at least 55 points, no matter how played the second.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
The first move is to delete the numbers from the middle.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The first move must be to remove 9 numbers from 47 to 55. The remaining numbers are divided into pairs: 1 - 56, 2 - 57, ..., 46 - 101. After each move of the second player, the first one can rub out the numbers so that in each pair both numbers were deleted, or none. Thus, in the end there will be a pair of numbers, the difference of which is equal to 55.
