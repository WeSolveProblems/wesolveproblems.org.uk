<h1>Problem ID 88215</h1>
<p>
How, without any means of measurement, can you measure a length of 50 cm from a shoelace, whose length is 2/3 meters?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try cutting off a quarter of the shoelace.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If you cut off a quarter from the shoelace $($for this you need to fold it in half twice$)$, you will be left with just 50 cm. Indeed, 3/4 \times 2/3 = 1/2.
</p>
