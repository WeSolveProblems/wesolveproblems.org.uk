<h1>Problem ID 64990</h1>
<p>
Valentina added a number $($not equal to 0$)$ taken to the power of four and the same number to the power two and reported the result to Peter. Can Peter determine the unique number that Valentina chose?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since the equality $(-a)^2$ + $(-a)^4$ = $a^2$ + $a^4$ is true for any a, whatever number Valentina chooses, Peter will not be able to determine it.

</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
He cannot.
