<h1>Problem ID 103738</h1>
<p>
Among some number of mathematicians, every seventh is a philosopher, and among some number of philosophers every ninth is a mathematician. Who are there more of: philosophers or mathematicians?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Consider people who are both mathematicians and philosophers.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We denote by x the number of people who are both mathematicians and philosophers. Then the number of mathematicians is 7x, and the number of philosophers is 9x.
<p>
If x $ \ neq $ 0, then there are more philosophers. But what does x=0 mean? It means that neither the mathematicians nor the philosophers are greater in number, that is, they are "even" in number. This is the correct answer, formally satisfying the condition of the problem. And those who pointed it out are doubly good! Although a correct solution also occurred to those who had only analysed the case when mathematicians do still exist.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
If there is at least one philosopher or mathematician, then there are more philosophers.
