<h1>Problem ID 115492</h1>
<p>
The KUB is a cube. Prove that the ball, CIR, is not a cube. $($KUB and CIR are three-digit numbers, where different letters denote different numbers$)$.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Consider all the cubed numbers that are three-digit numbers. This is $5^3$ = 125, $6^3$ = 216, $7^3$ = 343, $8^3$ = 512, $9^3$ = 729 $($there are no others, because $4^3$ = 64 $<$100, and $10^3$ = 1000 $>$ 999$)$. Since different letters denote different digits, none of the numbers of KUB and CIR are equal to 343. But in all of the remaining cubed numbers there is a common number 2, and in the numbers of KUB and CIR, there are no common digits.
