</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We will put the whole class in one room. Let's consider some person A. Now let out of the room all the students who are not friends with A. By the condition, of such there are no more than five. Therefore, at least 15 students remain in the room. Choose from the remaining students in the room, a student B, different from A. Let out of the room all the students who are not friends with B. After that, there were at least 10 students left in the room. Finally, we choose from the remaining students in the room, a student C, different from A and B. Let out of the room all the students who are not friends with C. After that, there are at least five students left in the room. These five friends are A, B, C and two other students D and E who are friends with A, B, C. The four students who you are looking for are A, B, C, D.
