<h1>Problem ID 102998</h1>
<p>
Can the equality $K \times O \times T$ = $U \times W \times E \times N \times H \times Y$ be true if the numbers from 1 to 9 are substituted for letters instead of the letters? Different letters correspond to different numbers.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think whether the two parts of equality can be multiples of 7?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
One of the letters must necessarily correspond to the number 7 and then that part of the equality in which this letter lies will be divisible by 7, and the other will not.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
It cannot.
