<h1>Problem ID 98271</h1>
<p>
On a plane there is a square, and invisible ink is dotted at a point P. A person with special glasses can see the spot. If we draw a straight line, then the person will answer the question of on which side of the line does P lie $($ if P lies on the line, then he says that P lies on the line $)$.
What is the smallest number of such questions you need to ask to find out if the point P is inside the square?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let our square be ABCD. First we draw the diagonal AC. If it turns out that P lies on the same side from it as the vertex B, it will be sufficient to find out on which side of the lines AB and BC does the point P lie.
The case when the first person is asked to point to the half-plane containing the point D is similar.
If only one or two questions are given, then less than three lines are drawn. Whatever the answers $($ except for the case when the point belongs to the intersection of two straight lines $)$, we can only know whether the point belongs to those parts on which the plane is broken up by the drawn lines. But these parts are not limited, and simply belonging to them cannot be sufficient proof that the point lies in the square.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Three questions.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. 3 points.
<p>
2. For a similar problem, a convex 2k-gon $($ and thus a n-gon, where n $â‰¤$ 2k $)$ needs only k + 1 questions. Here the idea of a "dichotomy" - dividing in half - works: the first question is to find out which side of the line connecting the first vertex with the "opposite" $($ 2k-1 + 1 $)$ -th  vertex lies P, and $($ by induction $)$ we can reduce the problem to a similar one for a 2k-1-gon.
<p>
3. Similar problems in space are more complicated, but the idea of a "dichotomy" is useful there $($ it turned out to be a key one in the works of A. Khochiyan et al., Where, contrary to expectations, it was found that some problems of linear programming have polynomial complexity, that is, they are solved much faster, than a full search $)$.
