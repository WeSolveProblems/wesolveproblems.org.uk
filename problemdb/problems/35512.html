<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Prove, that in any group of friends there will be two people who have the same number of friends.</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>A group of friends cannot simultenously have a member who is friends with everyone in the group and a member who has no friends in the group.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Let the group of friends contain $n$ members. Each member of the group therefore has between $0$ and $n-1$ friends. So if $n$ people all had different numbers of friends, then in the group there would be one member who has $0, 1, 2,...,n-1$ friends. If there is a member who has $n-1$ friends, then this member is friends with everybody in the group. It follows, that there is no member with $0$ friends. This is a contradiction.</p>
