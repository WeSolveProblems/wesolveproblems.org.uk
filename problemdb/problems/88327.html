<h1>Problem ID 88327</h1>
<p>
We meet three people: Alex, Brian and Ben. One of them is an architect, the other is a baker and the third is an archeologist. One lives in Aberdeen, the other in Birmingham and the third in Brighton.
</p>

<p>
1) Ben is in Birmingham only for trips, and even then very rarely. However, all his relatives live in this city.
</p>

<p>
2) For two of these people the first letter of their name, the city they live in and their job is the same.
</p>

<p>
3) The wife of the architect is Ben's younger sister.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
From 1) and 3) we must have that the architect is Ben's relative, and so lives in Birmingham. From 2) we have that the archeologist lives in Aberdeen, and has a name beginning with A, so this must be Alex. We also know that the baker lives in Brighton and has a name beginning with B, so this must be Ben. Then, we can deduce that Brian is the architect and lives in Birmingham.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Ben: baker from Brighton. Brian: architect from Birmingham. Alex: archeologist from Aberdeen.
