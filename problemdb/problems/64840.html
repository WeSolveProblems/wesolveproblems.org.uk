<h1>Problem ID 64840</h1>
<p>
Author: E.V. Bakaev<p>

From the beginning of the academic year, Andrew wrote down his marks for mathematics. When he received another evaluation (2, 3, 4 or 5), he called it unexpected, if before that time this mark was met less often than each of the other possible marks. (For example, if he had received the following marks: 3, 4, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3 from the beginning of the year, the first five and the second four would have been unexpected). For the whole academic year, Andrew received 40 marks - 10 fives, fours, threes and twos (it is not known in which order). Is it possible to say exactly how many marks were unexpected?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The first unexpected marks will be the last one received for the first time. The second unexpected mark will be the last marks, received the second time, etc. So, there will be only 10 unexpected marks.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, he can.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
5 points.
