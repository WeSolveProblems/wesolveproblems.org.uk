<h1>Problem ID 88095</h1>
<p>
A page of a calendar is partially covered by the previous torn sheet $($see the figure$)$. The vertices A and B of the upper sheet lie on the sides of the bottom sheet. The fourth vertex of the lower leaf is not visible - it is covered by the top sheet. The upper and lower pages, of course, are identical in size to each other. Which part of the lower page is greater, that which is covered or that which is not?

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The area of the uncovered areas 1', 2' and 3' is equal to the area of the covered sections 1, 2 and 3 $($see the figure$)$. Hence, the covered part of the page is greater than the uncovered part by the areas of the covered section 4.
