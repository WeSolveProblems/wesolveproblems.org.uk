<h1>Problem</h1>
Lessons at the Evening Mathamatical School take place in nine auditoriums. Among others 19 students attend from the same school.
a) Prove that no matter how these students are arranged, at least one auditorium will contain no fewer than 3 students.
b) Is it true that one of the auditoriums must contain exactly 3 of these students?

<h1>Solution</h1>
a) Assume that no auditorium contains 3 or more students from the school. This means that each auditorium contains at most two from the same school, so there can be at most $2 \times 9 = 18$ students from the school in total. This is less than the 19 stated in the question, so is a contradiction. Hence, there must be an auditorium which contains at least 3 students.
b) No - for example all 19 students could stay in the same auditorium.


<h1>Answer</h1>
b) No.
