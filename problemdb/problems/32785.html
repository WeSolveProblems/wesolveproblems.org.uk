<h1>Problem ID 32785</h1>
<p>Lessons at the Evening Mathematical School take place in nine auditoriums. Amongst the class were 19 students from the same school.</p>
<p>a) Prove that no matter how these students are arranged at least one auditorium will contain no fewer than 3 of these students.</p>
<p>b) Is it true that one of the auditoriums must contain exactly 3 of these students?</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>a) Assume that no auditorium contains 3 or more students from the school. This means that each auditorium contains at most two from the same school, so there can be at most $2 \times 9 = 18$ students from the school in total. This is less than the 19 stated in the question, so is a contradiction. Hence, there must be an auditorium which contains at least 3 students.</p>
<p>b) No - for example all 19 students could stay in the same auditorium.</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>b) No.</p>
