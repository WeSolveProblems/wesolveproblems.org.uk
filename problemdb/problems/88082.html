<h1>Problem ID 88082</h1>
<p>
  Is it possible to arrange 44 marbles into 9 piles, so that the number of marbles in each pile is different?
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Think about how many marbles are needed in order to fulfil the conditions of the problem.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let's assume that it is possible. If we arrange the piles in order of increasing size then the first pile must contain at least 1 marble, the second at least 2, the third at least 3, and so on. Therefore, the total number of marbles must be at least $ 1 + 2 + 3 ... + 9 = 45 $ . But we have only 44 - therefore this is a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  No.
