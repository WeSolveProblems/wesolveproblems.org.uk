<h1>Problem ID 87959</h1>
<p>
The best student in the class, Katie, made up a huge number, writing out in a row all of the natural numbers from 1 to 500: 123 ... 10111213 ... 499500. The second-best student, Tom, erased the first 500 digits of this number. What do you think, what number does the remaining number begin with?
<p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Pay attention: Tom was erasing digits, and Katie was writing single-digit, double-digit and three-digit numbers.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Of the 500 digits erased by Tom, 9 numbers will be made up of single digits, which means that 491 digits remain. $90 \times 2$ = 180 digits are used for all the two-digit numbers, which leaves 311 digits. Out of these numbers, there will be 103 three-digit numbers and two more numbers from the 104th. This means that the number that we are interested in is the 3rd digit of the 104th three-digit number. This number is 203, which means that the desired digit is 3.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
3.
