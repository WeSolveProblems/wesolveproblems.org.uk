<h1>Problem ID 102844</h1>
<p>
The cells of a $15 \times 15$ square table are painted red, blue and green.
Prove that there are two lines which at least have the same number of cells of one colour.

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Letâ€™s assume the contrary. Then in each two lines there is a different number of cells that are red, and the total number of red cells in the table is not less than
0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 13 + 14 = 105. The same is true for blue and green cells. Then the total number of cells in the table cannot be less $3 \times 105$ = 315 cells, and at the same time we know that there are $15^2$ = 225 cells in total. This is a contradiction.
