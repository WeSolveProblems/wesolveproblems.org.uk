<h1>Problem ID 116809</h1>
<p>
A monkey, donkey and goat decided to play a game. They sat in a row, with the monkey on the right. They started to play the violin, but very poorly. They changed places and then the donkey was in the middle. However the violin trio still didn't sound as they wanted it to. They changed places once more. After changing places 3 times, each of the three "musicians" had a chance to sit in the left, middle and right of the row. Who sat where after the third change of seats?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
They monkey did not sit in the centre in the first or second positions, so the monkey must be in the centre in the third position. The donkey did not sit on the right in the first or second position, so the donkey must be on the right in the third position. This means that (in the third position) the goat must be sitting on the left.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
From left to right: the goat, the monkey, the donkey.
