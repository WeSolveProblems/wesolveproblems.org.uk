<h1>Problem ID 107702</h1>
<p>
  The surface of a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube contains 54 squares. What is the maximum number of squares we can mark, so that no marked squares share a vertex or are directly adjacent to another marked square?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  The diagram below shows how 7 squares on the three visible faces of the cube can be marked. On the rear three faces we can mark squares symmetrically to those shown.

<p>
  We will now prove, that it is not possible to mark more than 14 squares in the required way.
</p>
<p>
  Divide the surface of the cube as shown on the diagram below, again dividing the hidden faces symmetrically. It is easy to see that any two squares marked in the same part of the diagram will share a vertex or be adjacent to another marked piece. Therefore no more than 1 square in each part of the diagram can be marked, so no more than 14 squares can be marked in total.
