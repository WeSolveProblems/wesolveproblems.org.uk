<h1>Problem ID 31070</h1>
<p>
In a circle, each member has one friend and one enemy. Prove that
<p>
a$)$ the number of members is even.
<p>
b$)$ the circle can be divided into two neutral circles.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
a$)$ The whole circle is broken up into pairs of friends.
<p>
b$)$ Since the degree of each vertex of the corresponding graph is 2, it is divided into cycles. In each cycle, the edges of "friendship" and "enmity" alternate, hence, there is an equal number of both. Putting in the same circle every other member of each cycle, we get a circle where there are no friends or enemies. The remaining members form the second neutral circle.
