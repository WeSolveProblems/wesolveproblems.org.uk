<h1>Problem ID 31110</h1>
<p>
Prove that in a bipartite planar graph E $≥$ 2F, if E $≥$ 2 $($ E is the number of edges, F is the number of regions $)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
In a bipartite planar graph, each region is bounded by at least four edges. Therefore, the argument is analogous to the solution of the problem number 30797 and leads to the inequality E $≥$ 2F.
