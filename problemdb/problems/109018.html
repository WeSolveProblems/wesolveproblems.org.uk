<h1>Problem ID 203828</h1>
<p>
  A circle is covered with several arcs. These arcs can overlap one another, but none of them cover the entire circumference. Prove that it is always possible to select several of these arcs so that together they cover the entire circumference and add up to no more than 720$^{\circ}$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
	If three arcs cover some part of the circle, so that they all have a common part, then from these one can always choose two arcs such that the same part of the circle is still covered. Therefore, extra arcs can be discarded so that each part of the circle will be covered no more than twice, and so the sum of the covering arcs will be no more than 720$^{\circ}$.
