<h1>Problem ID 61018</h1>
<p>
Prove that the root a of the polynomial $P (x)$ has multiplicity greater than 1 if and only if $P (a) = 0$ and $P '(a) = 0$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Since a is a root, $P (x) = (x - a)^2Q (x) + p (x - a)$. The root has multiplicity greater than one if and only if p = 0. It remains to verify that $P '(a) = p$. This can be seen from the formula $P '(x) = (x - a) 2Q' (x) + 2 (x - a) Q (x) + p$.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
