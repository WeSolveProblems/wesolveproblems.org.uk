<h1>Problem ID 34872</h1>
<p>
On a function f $($x$)$, defined on the entire real line, it is known that for any a$>$1 the function $f (x) + f (ax)$ is continuous on the whole line. Prove that $f (x)$ is also continuous on the whole line.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We use the following properties of continuous functions: the sum and difference of continuous functions are continuous; if $g (x)$ is a continuous function, then the function $g (ax)$ is also continuous. By hypothesis, the functions $f (x) + f (4x)$ and $f (x) + f (2x)$ are continuous. Together with the function $f (x) + f (2x)$, the function $f (2x) + f (4x)$ is continuous. Therefore, the function $(f (x) + f (2x)) + (f (x) + f (4x)) - (f (2x) + f (4x)) = 2f (x)$ is also continuous, and hence the function $f (x)$.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
