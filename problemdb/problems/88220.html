<h1>Problem ID 88220</h1>
<p>
The Olympic gold-medallist Greyson, the silver-medallist Blackburn and bronze-medallist Reddick met in the club before training. "Pay attention," remarked the black-haired one, "one of us is grey-haired, the other is red-haired, the third is black-haired. But none of us have the same colour hair as in our surnames. Funny, is not it?‚Äù. "You're right," the gold-medallist confirmed. What colour is the hair of the silver-medallist?

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Remember problem numbers 71, 132, 144.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The black-haired was not a gold-medallist $($as the silver-medallist confirmed his statement$)$. This means that the black-haired man is Reddick. Greyson then can only have red hair, and the silver-medallist, Blackburn, has grey hair. 
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
Grey-haired.
