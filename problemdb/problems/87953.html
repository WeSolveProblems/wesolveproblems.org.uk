<h1>Problem ID 87953</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to bake a cake that can be divided by one straight cut into 4 pieces?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Notice that the cake does not have to be a convex figure.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If the cake were a convex figure, it would not be possible to do this, but it is not said anywhere that it should be like that. You can, for example, bake a cake in the form of the letter "E" and cut it as shown in the picture.
