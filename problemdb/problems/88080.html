To solve this problem, we write down the letters with the numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 12, 21, 22, 26. These will be, respectively, "A", "B", “E”, “F”, “L”, “U”, “V”, “Z”. Now let's look at the options. The first letter is either "B" or "V". In the first case, further variants of "BBBA", "BBU", "BVA", "BBU", "BBUL", "BVL" are possible. No English word begins with such letters. Hence, the first letter in the word will be "V". Let's continue. Further, the letter combinations can now be "VBUB", "VBAB", “VBAV", "VUBB", "VUVU", "VUVA". Among these combinations, only "VUVU" give hope for finding the desired word. Continuing the search, we get the only possible answer: "VUVUZELA".
