<h1>Problem ID 65349</h1>
<p>
Every day, Patrick the dog chews one slipper from the available stock in the house. Strictly with a probability of 0.5 Patrick wants to chew the left slipper, and with a probability of 0.5 - the right one. If the desired slippers are not present, Patrick becomes upset. How many pairs of the same slippers need to be bought, so that with a probability of not less than 0.8 Patrick does not get upset for an entire week $($7 days$)$?

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
  Let Patrick want to chew S left and 7 - S right slippers in one week. We need to find a k such that $P (S \leq k âˆ© 7 - S \leq k) \geq 0.8$. We write the event in brackets differently: $P (7 - k \leq S \leq k)$. It is clear that $7 - k \leq k$, that is, $k \geq 4$.
  The probability on the left-hand side of the inequality is equal to the sum

<p>
  Note that <img src="65349 3.gif">
therefore, there is already a sum <img src="65349 4.png">
. Hence, the smallest k equals 5.

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
5 pairs.
