<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A number is written on each edge of a cube. The sum of the 4 numbers on the adjacent edges is written on each face. Place the numbers 1 and -1 on the edges so that the numbers written on the faces are all different.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Assume that we managed to do this. Then on each of the faces of the cube there is one of 5 possible numbers $ -4, -2, 0, 2$ or $4$. However there are 6 edges, meaning two of the faces must have the same value written on them. This is a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>It is impossible. </p>
