<h1>Problem ID 57211</h1>
<p>
Construct a triangle along the side a, the side b and height to side a, $h_a$.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose that the triangle ABC is constructed. Let H be the base of the height dropped from the vertex A. The rectangular triangle ACH can be constructed from the hypotenuse AC = b and the line AH = $h_a$. Then on the line CH we construct the point B so that CB = a.
