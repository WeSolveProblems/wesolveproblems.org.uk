<h1>Problem ID 104074</h1>
<p>
In the garden of Sandra and Lewis 2006 rose bushes were growing. Lewis watered half of all the bushes, and Sandra watered half of all the bushes. At the same time it turned out that exactly three bushes, the most beautiful, were watered by both Sandra and Lewis. How many rose bushes have not been watered?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Lewis watered 1003 bushes, of which 1,000 were watered once, and three Sandra also watered. Similarly, Sandra watered 1003 bushes, of which 1000 she watered alone, and three - with Lewis. So, together they watered 1000 + 1000 + 3 = 2003 bush. Therefore, there remain 2006 - 2003 = 3 rose bushes that were not watered.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
3 bushes.
