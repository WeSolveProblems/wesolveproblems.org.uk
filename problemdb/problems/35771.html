<h1>Problem ID 35771</h1>
<p>
Does a continuous function that takes every real value exactly 3 times exist?
 
</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
An example can be found in the form of a sum of periodic and linear functions.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
One of the possible options is a function whose graph is a "saw". Another option is the function f$(x)$ = 2x/3$\pi$ + sin x $. This is an example of a "smoothed saw".
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes, such a function does exist.
