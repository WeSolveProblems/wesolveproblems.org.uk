<h1>Problem</h1>
A standard chessboard has more than a quarter of its squares filled with chess pieces. Prove that at least two adjacent (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally) squares are occupied somewhere on the board.
<h1>Hint</h1>
Divide the board into 2x2 squares.

<h1>Solution</h1>
Divide the board into 16 2x2 squares. If in each of those squares no more than one square is occupied, then on the entire board there can be no more than 16 pieces - exactly a quarter of the squares on the board. If there are more pieces than this, then at least one of the 2x2 squares will contain more than 1 piece, meaning those two pieces will be adjacent.
