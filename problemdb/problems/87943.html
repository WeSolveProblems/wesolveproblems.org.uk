<h1>Problem ID 87943</h1>
<p>
 There are two hourglasses - one for 7 minutes and another for 11 minutes. An egg is boiled for 15 minutes. How can this time be measured with the help of the available hourglasses?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
With the help of two different hourglasses, you can measure not only the time equal to their "sum", but also the time equal to their "difference".

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
"Turn on" at the same time the two hourglasses. When the 7-minute hourglass is finished, we turn it over and let both run for 4 minutes, until the end of the 11-minute hourglass. Now we turn back over the 7-minute hourglass, which will have been seeping for exactly 4 minutes, and time until the whole hourglass was "poured" out. This whole process would then add up to 15 minutes.
