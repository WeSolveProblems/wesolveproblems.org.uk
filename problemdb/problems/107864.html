<h1>Problem ID 107864</h1>
<p>
A continuous function f has the following properties:
<p>
1. f is defined on the entire number line;
<p>
2. f at each point has a derivative $($ and thus the graph of f at each point has a unique tangent $)$;
<p>
3. the graph of the function f does not contain points for which one of the coordinates is rational and the other is irrational.
<p>
Does it follow that the graph of f is a straight line?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>

 <p> 
Example:
<p>
f $(x)$ = {2 â€“ x, if x $\geq$ 1;1 / x if x $>$ 1.
$($ the graph of this function is shown in the figure.$)$. The fulfilment of the first property is obvious, the fulfilment of the second property follows from the fact that the derivatives of the functions 2 - x and 1 / x at the point 1 are equal.
Let us prove the third property. Obviously, if x is rational, then f $(x)$ is rational. Let y = f $(x)$ be rational. Then either x = 2 - y, or x = 1/y. In any case, x is rational. Hence a rational x corresponds to a rational f $(x)$ and vice versa.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
No, it does not.
