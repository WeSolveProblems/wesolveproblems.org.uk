<h1>Problem ID 57371</h1>
<p>
Prove that the sum of the distances from an arbitrary point to three vertices of an isosceles trapezium is greater than the distance from this point to the fourth vertex.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In the isosceles trapezoid ABCD, the diagonals AC and BD are equal. Therefore, BM + $($AM + CM$)$ $\geq$ BM + AC = BM + BD $\geq$ DM.
</p>
