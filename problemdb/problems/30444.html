<h1>Problem ID 30444</h1>
<p>
Two people take turns placing kings on squares of a $9 \times 9$ chessboard such that the kings cannot attack each other. The loser is the player who cannot make a move. Which player wins the game, if the right strategy is used? 

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first player wins. The strategy is to place the king in the centre of the board in the first turn and then to use central symmetry.
