<h1>Problem ID 58300</h1>
<p>
Do there exist three points A, B and C on the plane such that for any point X the length of at least one of the segments XA, XB and XC is irrational?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Yes, there are. Let C be the midpoint of AB. Then $XC^2 = (2XA^2 + 2XB^2 â€“ AB^2)/2$. If the number $AB^2$ is irrational, then the numbers XA, XB and XC cannot be rational at the same time.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, such points do exist.
