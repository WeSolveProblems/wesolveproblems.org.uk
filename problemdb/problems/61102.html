<h1>Problem ID 61102</h1>
<p>
It is known that cos α$^{\circ}$ = 1/3. Is α a rational number?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let α = m / n. Then cos $(360^{\circ} nα)$ = 1. Since cos $(360^{\circ} nα)$ = $T_{360n}$ $($ cos α $^{\circ}$)$ $($ for the definition of Chebyshev polynomials see problem number 61099 $)$, the polynomial $T_{360n}$ $(x)$ -1 tends to zero for x = cos $^{\circ}$ = 1/3. Therefore, the polynomial f $(x)$ = $2T_{360n}$ $(x / 2)$ -2 has a root of 2/3. According to Problem number 61101, f $(x)$ is a reduced polynomial with integer coefficients, but by the theorem on rational roots the polynomial $($ see problem 61013 $)$ f $(x)4 can have only integer roots.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
No, it is not.
