<h1>Solution</h1>
Fig. 22 shows how to cut the given figure into 18 equal-sized triangles. Let us prove that this number is the maximum possible. We take the area of the cell as equal to one unit. The figure shown is a nonconvex hexagon ABCDEF of area 63 with an angle of 270 at the vertex D $($Figure 21$)$. If we divide the figure into triangles, then it is obvious that the point D must belong to at least two triangles, one of which lies on the line DE, and the other side lies on the DC. Moreover, for at least one of them, it lies on the corresponding segment. For certainty, suppose that this is a triangle DKL, where K âˆˆ [DC]. Then the base DK of this triangle is no greater than DC = 1, and the height is no greater than BC = 7. Therefore, the area of the triangle DKL is no greater than 7/2. By assumption, we can divide this figure into equal triangles. Since the area of one triangle is no greater than 7/2, then all triangles are no less than 63/[7/2] = 18. </p>
