<h1>Problem ID 30787</h1>
<p>
In a graph, all the vertices have degree of 3. Prove that there is a cycle in it.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We consider an arbitrary connected component of this graph. It is not a tree, since it has no hanging vertex $($ see problem number 30786 $)$. Hence, there is a cycle in it.
