<h1>Problem ID 109423</h1>
<p>
At the end of the term, Billy wrote out his current singing marks in a row and put a multiplication sign between some of them. The product of the resulting numbers turned out to be equal to 2007. What is Billyâ€™s term mark for singing? $($The marks that he can get are between 2 and 5, where 5 is the highest mark$)$.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
2007 = $3 \times 3 \times 223$ = $9 \times 223$ = $3 \times 669$. Since the mark 9 does not exist, only the first option is suitable. Since the number of 3s that Billy has is greater than the number of 2s, and the last mark, no matter how you rearrange the multipliers, is a three, one can assume that he will get a three in the term.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Three.
