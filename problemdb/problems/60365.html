<h1>Problem ID 60365</h1>
<p>
An endless board is painted in three colours $($each cell is painted in one of the colours$)$. Prove that there are four cells of the same colour, located at the vertices of the rectangle with sides parallel to the side of one cell.

</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the board be painted in two colours. Let’s consider an arbitrary column in which one of the colours occurs an infinite number of times. Let’s fix this colour. Now erase all of the lines from the table that do not contain the fixed colour in the selected column. Show that in the remaining table you can find the four necessary cells. To solve this problem with an arbitrary number of colours, apply mathematical induction.
