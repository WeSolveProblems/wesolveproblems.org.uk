<h1>Problem ID 120601</h1>
<p>
  Some open sectors - that is sectors of circles with infinite radii - completely cover a plane. Prove that the sum of the angles of these sectors is no less than $360^\circ$.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  If all the sectors are centred at a point $O$, then if the total angle is less than $360^\circ$ there will be a ray from $O$ that is not covered by an angle.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Assume that the total angle is less than $360^\circ$. Consider a point $O$ in the plane. Translate every open sector so that it is centred on $O$. Since the angles total less than $360^\circ$, there will be a ray $m$ we can draw from $O$ that does not lie within any open sector. Now translate all of the sectors back to their original positions. At most only a line segment of ray $m$ can be covered by the sectors, that is it is possible for the open sector to not intersect with the ray $m$ at all, intersect at a point, or intersect twice with a line segment of $m$ between the two intersections. Therefore the given open sectors carve out only a finite number of line segments from the ray $m$. Therefore the ray $m$ is not completely covered by the open sectors, and therefore neither is the entire plane. This is a contradiction.
