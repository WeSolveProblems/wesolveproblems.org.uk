<h1>Problem</h1>
a) Prove that within any 6 whole numbers, there will be two that have a difference between them that is a multiple of 5.
b) Will this statement remain true, if instead of the difference we considered the total?

<h1>Solution</h1>
a) See Problem id 21972
b) If for example, all 5 numbers give remainder 1 when divided by 5, the total of any two of them will give a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 - that is, it will not be divisible by 5.
<h1>Answer</h1>
b) No.
