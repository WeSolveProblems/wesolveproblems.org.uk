<h1>Problem ID 30785</h1>
<p>
Prove that, in a tree, every two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path.
</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let’s suppose the contrary is true and let’s consider those two vertices that are connected by two different simple paths.
<p>
Now let’s choose the first point at which these paths diverge. Now for the selected point on path 1, we take the first point also belonging to path 2. The sections of the first and second paths between the selected points form a simple cycle, which cannot occur in a tree.
