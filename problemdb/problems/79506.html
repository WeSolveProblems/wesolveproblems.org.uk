<h1>Problem ID 79506</h1>
<p>
Prove that from any 27 different natural numbers less than 100, two numbers that are not coprime can be chosen.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Consider an arbitrary set of 27 different positive integers less than 100. For each number in the set, we mark either one of its prime divisors $($if this number is not equal to one) or one (if this number is equal to one$)$. Since there are only 25 prime numbers less than one hundred, we must have marked a certain number twice. This number could not be one, since we marked the number one with one. Consequently, there are two numbers in this set with a common prime divisor, that is, two numbers that are not mutually prime.
