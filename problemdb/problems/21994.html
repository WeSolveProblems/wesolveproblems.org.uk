<h1>Problem ID 21994</h1>
<p>
  Some whole numbers are placed into a 10x10 table, so that the difference between any two neighbouring, horizontally or vertically adjacent, squares is no greater than 5. Prove that there will always be two identical numbers in the table.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Since it is possible to get from any square to any other by 'moving' to an adjacent square at most 19 times, all of the numbers in the table must lie between $a$ and $a+95$ where $a$ is the smallest number in the table. Hence there can be no more than 96 different numbers on the table.
