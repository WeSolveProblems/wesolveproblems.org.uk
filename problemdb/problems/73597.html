<h1>Problem ID 73597</h1>
<p>
Prove that for any odd natural number, a, there exists a natural number, b, such that $2^b$ - 1 is divisible by a.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let us consider the numbers $2^0$ - 1, $2^1$ - 1, ..., $2^a$ - 1. There are a+1 of these. Therefore, there must be two numbers that give the same remainder when divided by a, because there are only a distinct remainders. Suppose, for example, that the numbers $2^k$ - 1 and $2^m$ - 1 give identical remainders when divided by a and k $<$ m. Then the number $($$2^m$ - 1$)$ - $($$2^k$ - 1$)$ = $2^k$ $($$2^$($m-k$)$$ - 1$)$ is divisible by a and, since a is odd, $2^$($m-k$)$$ - 1 is divisible by a.
</p>
<h1>Remarks</h1>
1. A more general fact can be proved in exactly the same way: if the natural numbers a and c are coprime, then there is a positive integer b such that $c^b$-1 is divisible by a.
</p>
2. The assertion of this problem also follows from Euler's theorem.
