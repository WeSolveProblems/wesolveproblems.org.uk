<h1>Problem ID 57370</h1>
<p>
Prove that if two opposite angles of a quadrilateral are obtuse, then the diagonal connecting the vertices of these angles is shorter than the other diagonal.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the angles B and D of the quadrilateral ABCD be obtuse. Then points B and D lie inside a circle with diameter AC. Since the distance between any two points lying inside the circle is less than its diameter, then BD $<$ AC.
