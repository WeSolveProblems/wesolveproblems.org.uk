<h1>Problem ID 110122</h1>
<p>
Author: A.S. Golovanov
<p>
The functions f $($x$)$ - x and $f (x^2) - x^6$ are defined for all positive x and increase. Prove that the function <IMG SRC="110122 1.gif"> also increases for all positive x.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
   Further, all of the functions are considered only on the positive semi-axis. We note that an increase in $g (x^n)$ is equivalent to an increase in g $($x$)$, and an increase in a function of the form $f (x) - g (x)$ is equivalent to the condition $f (x) -f (y)> g (x) -g (y )$ for x $>$ y.
<p>
   So, we need to prove that <IMG SRC="110122 23.gif"> for x $>$ y.
<p>
   Note that $4 (x^2 + xy + y^2) = 3 (x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2 â‰¥ 3 (x + y)^2$. Consequently, <IMG SRC="110122 34.gif">
   Multiplying by x - y, we get that <IMG SRC="110122 5.gif">
   for x$>$ y.
<p>
   By virtue of the increase in the functions $f (x) - f (y)$ $>$ max ${x - y, x^3 - y^3}$ indicated in the condition, the required inequality is proved.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
