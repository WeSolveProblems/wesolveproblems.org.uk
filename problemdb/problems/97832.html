<h1>Problem ID 97832</h1>
<p>
f$(x)$ is an increasing function defined on the interval [0, 1]. It is known that the range of its values belongs to the interval [0, 1]. Prove that, for any natural N, the graph of the function can be covered by N rectangles whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes so that the area of each is $1/N^2$. $($In a rectangle we include its interior points and the points of its boundary$)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
   We will plug the "holes" in the graph with vertical segments $($by connecting the limit on the left and the limit on the right at the break point$)$. If we now interchange the coordinate axes, we obtain a graph of a continuous non-decreasing function. Therefore, we can assume that the original function is continuous. For the same reasons, we can assume that its graph contains points $($0, 0$)$ and $($1, 1$)$.
<p>
   Let $A_k (k = 0, 1, ..., N)$ be the point of intersection of the graph with the line x + y = 2k/N. The section of the graph between $A_k$ and $A_{k + 1}$ is covered by a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes of coordinates, $($ which is non-degenerate with diagonal $A_kA_{k + 1}$ or degenerate is the segment $A_kA_{k + 1}$$)$ of the perimeter 4/N, that is, an area that is not larger than $1/N^2$. Increasing each rectangle to the area $1/N^2$, we obtain the required covering.

   </p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above. 

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
1.	9 points $($the preparatory version, where the continuity of the function f was also assumed, is worth 8 points$)$.

2. Compare with problem number M884 from the “Quant” problems.
