<h1>Problem ID 98534</h1>
<p>
In Conrad’s collection there are four royal gold five-pound coins. Conrad was told that some two of them were fake. Conrad wants to check $($ prove or disprove $)$ that among the coins there are exactly two fake ones. Will he be able to do this with the help of two weighings on weighing scales without weights? $($ Counterfeit coins are the same in weight, real ones are also the same in weight, but false ones are lighter than real ones. $)$

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let Conrad first weigh some two coins. We consider two cases.
1$)$ The scales are in balance. Conrad can compare the weights of two coins lying $($ in the first weighing $)$ on one cup. If their weights are equal, then the weights of all the coins are equal, that is, there are either 0 or 4 false coins. If the weights are not equal, then exactly one of them is fake. But then on the other cup exactly one is counterfeit, that is, there are exactly two counterfeit coins.
<p>
2$)$ The weights of the cups are not equal. Then the counterfeit coins of which there are either one or two $($ in this case they lie on one cup $)$ or three. Conrad can take a coin from each cup and swap them. If there are two counterfeit coins, then the scales will be balanced, otherwise they will not be balanced.
In any case, Conrad’s verification will be successful.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes he will succeed.
