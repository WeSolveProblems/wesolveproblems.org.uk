<h1>Problem ID 35294</h1>
<p>
There are three sets of dominoes of different colours. How can you put the dominoes from all three sets into a chain $($according to the rules of the game$)$ so that every two neighbouring dominoes are of a different colour?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Form a chain from the first set, and then between the neighbouring dominos put two dominoes from the other two sets.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the colours of the domino sets be white, blue and red. Form a chain from all the white dominoes $($as you know, this can be done$)$. Consider the first domino in the chain, let it be the domino with numbers x and y. Letâ€™s put, between the first and second white dominoes, the blue y|x domino and the red x|y domino. After this, the domino rules will still be satisfied, since the red domino, like the first white domino, ends in y. In the same way, after each white domino we can insert a blue and a red domino of the same "property."</p>
