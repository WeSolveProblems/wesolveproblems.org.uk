<h1>Problem ID 88217</h1>
<p>
In the town of Ely, all families have separate houses. On one fine day, each family moved into a house that used to be occupied by another family. In this regard, it was decided to paint all houses in red, blue or green, and so that for each family the colour of the new and old houses did not match. Can this be done?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
All the families of the city can be divided into closed chains, in which after each family there will be that family into whose house the first family has moved into $($maybe there will only be one chain$)$. In the chains made up of an even number of families, we will paint the houses alternately in blue and green - then each family will move from a blue house to green one or vice versa. And in those chains where the number of families is odd, we will paint one house in red, and the remaining even number of houses - alternately in blue and green. Then all of the houses will be painted in a way that fulfils the requirements of the problem.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes, it can.
