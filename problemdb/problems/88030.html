<h1>Problem ID 88030</h1>
<p>
The stepmother, leaving for the ball, gave Cinderella a sack which contained a mixture of poppy and millet, and ordered them to be sorted. When Cinderella was leaving for the ball, she left three sacks: one contained millet, the other contained poppy, and in the third - a mixture that had not yet been sorted. In order not to confuse the sacks, Cinderella attached a label to each of them that said: "Poppy seed", "Millet" and "Mixture". The stepmother returned from the ball first and deliberately swapped all of the labels in such a way that on each sack there was an incorrect inscription. The fairy godmother managed to warn Cinderella that now none of the labels on the sacks were correct. Then Cinderella took out only one single grain from one sack and, looking at it, immediately guessed what was in each sack. How did she do this?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Think of whether it is possible to take a seed from a sack on which "Poppy seed" is written.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
It is necessary to take a seed from that sack which has the label "Mixture". There cannot be a mixture in it and this means that in this sack lie exactly those grains that will be taken out of it. Letâ€™s say that poppy seeds lie in this sack. $($This assumption is also made for the convenience of the presentation of this problem, however, as an exercise, try to repeat all the arguments for the case when millet is in the sack which has the "Mixture" label$)$. So, in the sack with the "Mixture" label lies poppy seed. This means that in the sack with the "Poppy seed" label there can only be millet $($if this sack contained a mixture, then the sack with the "Millet" label would contain millet, which is impossible$)$. It immediately follows that the sack with the "Millet" label contains the mixture.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
It is necessary to take a grain from the sack which has the "Mixture" label.
