<h1>Problem ID 88336</h1>
<p>
Decipher the numerical puzzle system
<p>
MA x MA = MIR
<p>
AM x AM = RIM
<p>
$($different letters correspond to different numbers, and identical letters correspond to the same numbers$)$.

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
From the first equation, it follows that M = 1, and from the second, that A does not exceed 3, then A = 2 or A = 3. Since $12 \times$ 12 = 144, then we get from the first equation that I = R, which is a contradiction. The case A = 3 gives the answer: $13 \times 13$ = 169, $31 \times 31$ = 961.
