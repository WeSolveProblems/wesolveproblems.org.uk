<h1>Problem ID 56656</h1>
<p>
Let a and b be the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle and c the length of its hypotenuse. Prove that:
<p>
a) The radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle is $($a + b - c$)$/2;
<p>
b) The radius of the circle that is tangent to the hypotenuse and the extensions of the sides of the triangle, is equal to $($a + b + c$)$/2.

</p>
