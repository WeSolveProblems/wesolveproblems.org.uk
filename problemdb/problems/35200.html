<h1>Problem ID 35200</h1>
<p>
  Two points are placed inside a convex pentagon. Prove that it is always possible to choose a quadrilateral that shares four of the five vertices on the pentagon, such that both of the points lie inside the quadrilateral.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  A straight line passing through both points crosses two sides of the pentagon.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Draw a straight line through the two given points. In one of the half-planes created by the straight line lie at least three vertices $A, B, C$ of the pentagon. If we cut off a triangle with vertices at $A, B, C$ from the pentagon we are left with a quadrilateral that contains both points, as required.
