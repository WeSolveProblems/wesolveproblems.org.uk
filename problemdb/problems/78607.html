<h1>Problem ID 78607</h1>
<p>
What is the maximum difference between neighbouring numbers, whose sum of digits is divisible by 7?

</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We first prove that this difference cannot be greater than 13. Indeed, among 13 consecutive natural numbers, at least one has digits, the sum of which is divisible by 7. This is because among 13 consecutive natural numbers at least 7 lie in one group of ten. But then the sums of the digits of these seven numbers are consecutive natural numbers, and hence among them there is a number that is divisible by seven. So, the required number is not more than 13. But between the numbers 993 and 1006 there are no other numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by seven, and 1006 - 993 = 13. So, the required difference is 13.
