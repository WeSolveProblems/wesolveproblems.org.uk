<h1>Problem</h1>
What is the maximum number of rooks you could place on a chess board (8 by 8) such that no two could take one another? (rooks aka castles can attack horizontally and vertically but not diagonally)
<h1>Hint</h1>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Obviously 8 are possible - if we place them for example diagonally from square a1 to h8.

We must now prove that it is impossible to place 9 rooks to fulfill the requirements of the question. By definition, there cannot be more than one rook on each row of the chessboard. Since there are 8 rows, it follows that more than 8 rooks is not possible.
