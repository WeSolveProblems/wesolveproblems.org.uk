<h1>Problem ID 32784</h1>
<p>What is the maximum number of rooks - also known as castles - you could place on an 8 by 8 chess board such that no two could take one another? Rooks can attack any number of squares horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Obviously 8 are possible - if we place them for example diagonally from square a1 to h8.</p>

<p>We must now prove that it is impossible to place 9 rooks to fulfill the requirements of the question. By definition, there cannot be more than one rook on each row of the chessboard. Since there are 8 rows, it follows that more than 8 rooks is not possible.</p>
