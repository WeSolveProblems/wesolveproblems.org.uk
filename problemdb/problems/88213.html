<h1>Problem ID 88213</h1>
<p>
It is known that in January there are four Fridays and four Mondays. What day of the week is January 1st?
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note that neither the 1st, nor the 2nd, nor the 3rd of January can occur on either Monday or Friday.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Neither the 1st, nor the 2nd, nor the 3rd of January can occur on Monday or Friday, because otherwise the 29th, the 30th or the 31st of January will be the fifth Friday or the fifth Monday in the month. Our condition can be fulfilled only if January 1st, 2nd and 3rd, respectively, falls on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. So, January 1st is a Tuesday.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
On Tuesday.
