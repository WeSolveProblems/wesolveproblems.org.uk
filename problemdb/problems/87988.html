<h1>Problem ID 87988</h1>
<p>
A girl chose a 4-letter word and replaced each letter with the corresponding number in the alphabet. The number turned out to be 2091425. What word did she choose?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Note: the first letterâ€™s corresponding number is either 2 or 20.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The number 2091425 must be divided into single-digit and two-digit numbers, so that the corresponding sequence of letters forms a 4-letter word. The first number cannot be 2, because otherwise the second number is 0 or 09, which cannot be the case. Hence, the first number is 20, i.e. the first letter is "T". The last number is 25, since otherwise the last two numbers would be 42 and 5 or 2 and 5, but the $42^{nd}$ letter does not exist in the alphabet, and the girl's word cannot end in "be" as it would not be a 4 letter word. So, the last letter is "Y". For the middle letters, there is a combination of 914, i.e. either 9, 1, 4, or 91, 4, or 9, 14. There is no $91^{st}$ letter in the alphabet so we discard the first option. The other combinations correspond to the sets of letters "iad" and "in". Hence, as we know that the word is made up of 4 letters, it is clear that the girl's chosen word is tiny.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
The girl's chosen word is tiny.
