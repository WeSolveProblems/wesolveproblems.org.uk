<h1>Problem ID 61457</h1>
<p>
Liouville's discrete theorem. Let $f (x, y)$ be a bounded harmonic function $($see the definition in problem number 11.28$)$, that is, there exists a positive constant M such that
$\forall (x, y) \in \mathbb {Z}^2 | f (x, y) | \leq M$.
<p>
Prove that the function $f (x, y)$ is equal to a constant.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Consider functions
$\Delta_ {x} f (x, y) = f (x + 1, y) - f (x, y)$ and $\Delta_ {y} f (x , y) = f (x, y + 1) - f (x, y)$,
which will also be limited and harmonious. Suppose that the function $\Delta_ {x}  f (x, y)$ is not equal to zero. Assume that $M = sup_{(x, y) \in \mathbb {Z}^2} \Delta_ {x} f (x, y)$. Then in the plane $ \mathbb {Z}^2$ one can find a square K of arbitrarily large size $(n \times n)$ such that $ \Delta_ {x} f (x, y) > M/2$ for all points K. It follows that the function $f (x, y)$ will increase when moving inside K parallel to the Ox axis by least $M \times n/2$. But this contradicts the boundedness of $f(x, y)$.

See the solution above.
