<h1>Problem ID 30810</h1>
<p>
At a conference there are 50 scientists, each of whom knows at least 25 other scientists at the conference. Prove that is possible to seat four of them at a round table so that everyone is sitting next to people they know.
</p>
<h1>Hint </h1>
<p>
	Consider two unfamiliar scientists and their acquaintances.
</p>
<h1>Solution </h1>
<p>
Consider two unfamiliar scientists $($if there are none, then everything is fine$)$. Each of them has 25 acquaintances among the remaining 48, so they have at least two common acquaintances. These four can be seated at the table.
