<h1>Problem</h1>
What is the largest number of kings that it is possible to place on a chess board such that no two check one another.
<h1>Hint</h1>
If any 2x2 square of the chessboard contains two kings, then they check one another.

<h1>Solution</h1>
Divide the chessboard into 16 2x2 squares. If in even one of these squares two kings are present, then they check one another. Therefore each square can contain at most 1 king, giving a maximum of 16 kings. In other words, if we place 16 kings in the bottom left hand corner of each 2x2 square, then the 16 kings will not check one another.

<h1>Answer</h1>
16
