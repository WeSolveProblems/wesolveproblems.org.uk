<h1>Problem ID 108995</h1>
<p>
Prove that, in a circle of radius 10, you cannot place 400 points so that the distance between each two points is greater than 1.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The circle of radius 10 has an area of 100π. If the distance between two points is 1, then circles of radius 0.5 with centres at these points touch each other. The area of 400 such circles of radius 0.5 is equal to $400 \times π \times 0,5^2$ = 100π. If such circles are placed next to each other, they will occupy an area larger than 100π squared units, since there will be gaps between the circles. Hence it is clear that they cannot be placed in a circle of radius of 10 units. Moreover, you cannot put 400 points in this circle so that the distance between them is greater than one.
