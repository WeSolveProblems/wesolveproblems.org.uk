<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A bag contains balls of two different colours - black and white. What is the minimum number of balls you need to remove, without looking, to guarantee that within the removed balls at least two are the same colour.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>In total you need to remove 3 balls. Consider the balls as pigeons, and the colours as roosting holes. Since there are fewer holes than pigeons, by the Pigeon Hole principle there will be a hole that contains at least two pigeons - that is two balls of the same colour. It is easy to see that if we remove two balls they could be different colours, so the minimum must be 3.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>3 balls</p>
