<h1>Problem ID 31072</h1> <p>
In some country 89 roads emerge from the capital, from the city of Dalny - one road, from the remaining 1988 cities - 20 roads $($in each$)$.
Prove that from the capital you can drive to Dalny.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
See problem number 30429.
<p>
We consider the connected component of the graph of roads containing the capital. Suppose that it does not contain Dalny. Then in this component of connectivity, from one vertex $($the capital$)$ there are 21 edges, and from all of the other vertices there are 20 edges. Thus, in this subgraph there is exactly one odd vertex. This contradicts problem number 87972 b).

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
