<h1>Problem ID 64622</h1>
<p>
The number x is such a number that exactly one of the four numbers

is not an integer.
Find all such x.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Note that b and c can not be integers at the same time. Indeed, then the number b + c = 2x is also an integer, which means that x is rational, therefore both a and d are not integers. So, one of the numbers b or c is not an integer, and then a and d must both be integers. Hence,

for a whole a. Then

 it follows that 2a + 2 = 0 $($otherwise d is irrational$)$. So, it remains to verify that the number found is suitable: the numbers a = -1, b = -2 and d = -3 will be integers.
