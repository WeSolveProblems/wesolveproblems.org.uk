<h1>Problem ID 65557</h1>
<p>
What is the largest number of horses that can be placed on an $8\times8$ chessboard so that no horse touches more than seven of the others?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Consider an example of an arrangement of 60 horses: all cells are occupied, except cells of the central square $2\times2$. We can show that, if the condition satisfies the arrangement, at least four cells remain free $($that is, more than 60 horses cannot be arranged$)$. Consider the central square of $4\times4$. If there are four empty cells in it, all is proved.
</p>
Let there be no more than three free empty cells in it, then there are at least 13 horses positioned. Each of them touches 8 cells of the board, one of which is free. It is easy to verify that a fixed horse, standing in the central square, can be touched attacked by no more than four horses. Consequently, the number of free cells is no less than 13/ 4 $>$ 3, that is, no less than 4.
