<h1>Problem</h1>
A bag contains balls of two different colours - black and white. What is the minimum number of balls you need to remove without looking, to guarantee that within the removed balls, at least two are the same colour.

<h1>Solution</h1>
In total you need to remove 3 balls. Consider the balls as rabbits, and the colours as hutches. Since there are fewer hutches than rabbits, by the Pigeon Hole principle there will be a hutch that contains at least two rabbits - that is two balls of the same colour. It is easy to see, that if we remove two balls they could be different colours, so the minimum must be 3.

<h1>Answer</h1>
3 balls
