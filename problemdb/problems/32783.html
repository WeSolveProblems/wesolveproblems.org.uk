<h1>Problem ID 32783</h1>
<p>
  33 representatives of four different races - humans, elves, gnomes, and goblins - sit around a round table.
</p>
<p>
  It is known that humans do not sit next to goblins, and that elves do not sit next to gnomes. Prove that some two representatives of the same peoples must be sitting next to one another.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  1) Consider which group is bigger - the group of humans and goblins, or the group of elves and gnomes. Without loss of generality assume that there are more humans and goblins. This means there must have at least 17 of them, since in total there are 33 representatives around the table.
</p>
<p>
  2)Let the gnomes and elves stand up from their places and leave. Of the remaining representatives there will always be two representatives sitting next to one another, since more than half of the seats are occupied. However these two representatives cannot be of different peoples, as by the rules given humans do not sit next to goblins. Therefore two representatives of the same species must be sitting next to one another.
