<h1>Problem ID 79625</h1>
<p>
Aladdin visited all of the points on the equator, moving to the east, then to the west, and sometimes instantly moving to the diametrically opposite point on Earth. Prove that there was a period of time during which the difference in distances traversed by Aladdin to the east and to the west was not less than half the length of the equator.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
First, let’s "glue" the opposite points of the equator. Then we can assume that Aladdin did not move along the equator, but along the circle obtained after gluing the points together. We will also assume that Aladdin did not teleport at any point in time and that he visited all of the planet’s points. Let 2πφ $($t$)$ be the angular coordinate of Aladdin at time t. Since Aladdin did not teleport at any time, the function φ can be chosen to be continuous. Then it suffices to prove the following assertion:
<p>
A continuous function $φ (t)$, where ${φ (t)}$ takes all possible values, is given. Prove that $ \max_ {t}φ (t) -  \min_ {t} φ (t) ≥ 1$. But this assertion is obvious: if this difference is less than one, then the function φ cannot take values from {$ \max_ {t} φ (t)$} to 1 and from 0 to {$\min_ {t} φ (t)$}.


</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
