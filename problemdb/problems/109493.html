<h1>Problem ID 109493</h1>

With a non-zero number, the following operations are allowed: $x \rightarrow \frac{1+x}{x}, x \rightarrow \frac{1-x}{x}$. Is it true that from every non-zero rational number one can obtain each rational number with the help of a finite number of such operations?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We denote our operations by $f (x) =\frac{1+x}{x}, g (x) =\frac{1-x}{x}$. We first prove that by successively applying them, we can obtain operations inverse to f and g. We have $f (g (f (x))) = -x$ and $f (g (f (g(f (x))))) = \frac{1}{1+x}$ for $x \neq 1$. Therefore, $f (g (f (f (g(f(x)))))) = x$ for x -1 and $f (g (f (g (f(g (x)))))) = x$ for $x \neq 1$. Further, from 2 one can get -2 $($and vice versa$)$. In addition, $f (-2) = ½, g (½) = 1$. Hence, one can obtain 1 of 2. Since $g (-1) = -2$, and from -2 it is possible to obtain 2, one can obtain 2 from -1. Since $g (2) = - ½$ and $f (- ½ ) = -1$, so -1 can be obtained from -2. Thus, the invertibility is proved. Hence, it suffices to prove that from the number 1, one can obtain all of the positive rational numbers. We prove this by induction on the sum of the numerator and the denominator of a fraction in its simplest form representing our rational number m/n. The induction base for m + n = 2 is obvious. Suppose that for m + n $<$k the number m/n can be obtained from 1. Let us prove that then for m + n = k the number m/n is obtained from the number 1. If m $>$ n, then $\frac{m}{n} = 1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n}}{m-n}$ and n + (m-n) = m $<$ m + n, therefore, the number $\frac{n}{m-n}$ can be obtained by the induction hypothesis. If
m $<$ n, then $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{n-m}{m}}$ and (n-m) + m = n $<$ m + n, therefore, the number $\frac{n-m}{m}$ can be obtained by the induction hypothesis. Hence, in both cases the number m/n can be obtained from the number 1, and so the induction transition is proved.
