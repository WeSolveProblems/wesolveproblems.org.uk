<h1>Problem ID 79539</h1>
<p>
Is there a line on the coordinate plane relative to which the graph of the function y = $2^x$ is symmetric?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Answer: no this line does not exist. Indeed, if the graph of the function y = $2^x$ is symmetric with respect to some line, then for symmetry with respect to this line the horizontal asymptote y = 0 of this the graph should coincide with some asymptote of this graph. But the graph of the function y = $2^x$ has no other asymptotes. Consequently, for this symmetry, the straight line y = 0 goes into itself, and hence the symmetry axis either coincides with the straight line y = 0, or is perpendicular to it. Checking that the straight line y = 0 and the straight lines of the form x = const are not axes of symmetry of the graph of the function y = $2^x$, is left to the reader as an exercise.
