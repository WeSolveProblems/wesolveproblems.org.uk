<h1>Problem ID 30687</h1>
<p>
a)	Two students need to be chosen to participate in a mathematical Olympiad from a class of 30 students. In how many ways can this be done?
<p>
b) In how many ways can a team of three students in the same class be chosen?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a)	The first student can be selected in 30 ways, the second one, regardless of the choice of the first student, in 29 ways. However, each pair is counted twice. Therefore, in total there are $30 \times 29$:2 ways.
<p>
  b) Similarly, we can obtain $30 \times 29 \times 28$ options for a consecutive choice of three students. Thus, each team is considered 3! = 6 times. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the team is equal to \frac{30x29x28}{3!}.
