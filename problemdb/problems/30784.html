<h1>Problem ID 30784</h1>
<p>
Prove that a graph, in which every two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path, is a tree.
</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Obviously, this graph is connected. Suppose now that there is a cycle in this graph. Then any two vertices of this cycle are connected by at least two simple paths. This is a contradiction.
