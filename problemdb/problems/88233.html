<h1>Problem ID 88233</h1>
<p>
Three friends - Peter, Ryan and Sarah - are university students, each studying a different subject from one of the following: mathematics, physics or chemistry. If Peter is the mathematician then Sarah isn't the physicist. If Ryan isn't the physicist then Peter is the mathematician. If Sarah isn't the mathematician then Ryan is the chemist. Can you determine which subject each of the friends is studying?

</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think about whether Ryan can be the mathematician.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose that Ryan isn't the physicist. Then (by the second condition) we have that Peter is the mathematician and (by the first condition) that Sarah isn't the physicist. This is a contradiction since one of them must be a physicist. This means that Ryan is the physicist. Then Sarah is the mathematician because if she wasn't then (by the third condition) Ryan would be the chemist. So Peter is the chemist. Therefore: Peter is the chemist, Ryan is the physicist and Sarah is the mathematician.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Peter is the chemist, Ryan is the physicist and Sarah is the mathematician.
