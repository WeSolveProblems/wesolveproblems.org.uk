<h1>Problem ID 65277</h1>
<p>
A and B shoot in a shooting gallery, but they only have one six-shot revolver with one cartridge. Therefore, they agreed in turn to randomly rotate the drum and shoot. A goes first. Find the probability that the shot will occur when A has the revolver.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
The shot occurs on an odd attempt $($when the revolver is at A$)$, in the remaining attempts the shot does not occur. Consequently, the required probability is the sum of 1/6 + $(5/6)^2 \times 1/6$ + $(5/6)^4 \times 1/6$ + ... = 6/11.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
6/11.
