<h1>Problem ID 102985</h1>
<p>
On a table, there are five coins lying in a row: the middle one lies with a head facing upwards, and the rest lie with the tails side up. It is allowed to simultaneously flip three adjacent coins. Is it possible to make all five coins positioned with the heads side facing upwards with the help of several such overturns?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try reversing the first three coins.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
It really can be done, and pretty quickly. We will turn the first three coins, then the first two coins will lie with the heads side facing upwards, and the last three will have the tails side facing upwards. Now we turn the last three coins and all five coins lie with the heads side facing upwards.
