<h1>Problem ID 30451</h1>
<p>
Consider a rectangular parallelepiped with size a) $4 \times 4 \times 4$; b) $4 \times 4 \times 3$; c) $4 \times 3 \times 3$, made up of unit cubes. Consider the game with two players where: in one turn a player is allowed to pierce through any row with a long wire, as long as there is at least one cube in the row with no wire. The loser is the player who cannot make a move. Who would win, if the right strategy is used?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a) and b): The second player wins, by using central symmetry. c) The first player wins. During the first turn they pierce the row consisting of central cubes from the layers of size $3 \times 3$. Then the first player uses central symmetry for the following turns.
