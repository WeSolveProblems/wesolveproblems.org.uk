<h1>Problem ID 64370</h1>
<p>
Authors: Folklore
<p>
There are 13 pupils in the school of witchcraft and wizardry. Before the Clairvoyance exam, the teacher put them at a round table and asked to guess who would receive the clairvoyant's diploma. The students said nothing about themselves and two of their neighbours, but they wrote the following about all of the others: "None of these ten will get the diploma!" Of course, all of those who passed the exam guessed correctly, and all of the other students were mistaken. How many wizards received a diploma?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Suppose that no one received a diploma. Then the statement of each pupil is true. In this case, everyone should have received diplomas, which is a contradiction. Hence, at least one of the students received the clairvoyantâ€™s diploma. He told the truth, so no one, except his neighbours, received a diploma. If both neighbours also remained without diplomas, then the statement "None of the ten will receive diplomas!" for each of them is true, but in fact they had to be mistaken! If both neighbours passed the exam, they both made a mistake in their statements. So, only one of the neighbours could pass the exam successfully. Indeed, in this case his statement is true, and the second neighbour's statement is false.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Two wizards.
