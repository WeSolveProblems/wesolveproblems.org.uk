<h1>Problem ID 30941</h1>
<p>
Every Martian has three hands. Can seven Martians join hands?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Altogether there are 21 hands, which is an odd number. If they joined hands, their hands would break into pairs $($each pair includes two hands that shake hands with each other$)$, and this is impossible.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
No, they cannot.
</p>
