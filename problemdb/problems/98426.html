<h1>Problem ID 98426</h1>
<p>
  A square is cut by 18 straight lines, 9 of which are parallel to one side of the square and the other 9 parallel to the other - perpendicular to the first 9 - dividing the square into 100 rectangles. It turns out that exactly 9 of these rectangles are squares. Prove that among these 9 squares there will be two that are identical.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If among these nine squares no two are identical, then each square lies in a different row and a different column to the others. This means that the rectangle which lies in the 10th row and the 10th column - which does not contain any of these 9 squares - must also be a square. This is a contradiction.
