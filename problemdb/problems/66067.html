<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  An after school club is attended by 4 boys from class 7A, and four from class 7B. Of those who attended - three  were named Ben, three were named Will and two were named Tom.
</p>
<p>
  Is it possible for it to be the case, that each boy had at least one namesake classmate who attended the club?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Assume this is the case. Then all three Bens must be in the same class (otherwise one of them would not have a namesake in the same class). Similarly all three Wills must be in the same class. Since only 4 children from each class attended, the Bens and the Wills must be in different classes. Therefore one of the Toms is in 7A and the other is in 7B. This is a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  No, it is not.
