<h1>Problem ID 88165</h1>
<p>
Ilya always tells the truth, but when he was asked the same question twice, he gave different answers to them. What kind of question could this be?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Remember problem numbers 140 and 148.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Ilyaâ€™s answer to the second question differs from the first, which means that something has changed. The question did not change. What could change, except for the question? Only the situation in which this question was asked. Since nothing is said in the condition of the problem, such as about the location, the identity of question setter, or the temperature of the air, etc., the properties of the situation, which can be ascertained, include, first, the number of questions that Ilya has already been asked and, second, time. So, there are two possible questions: "How many questions have I already asked you?" and "What time is it to the second?". If we allow ourselves to use the properties of the situation that are not involved in the condition of the problem, we can think up many explanations for the differences in the answers. For example, the same question: "I'm a man?" can first be asked by his Dad, and then by his Mum.

<h1>Answer</h1>
"How many questions have I already asked you?"
