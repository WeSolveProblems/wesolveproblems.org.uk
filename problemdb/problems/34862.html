<h1>Problem ID 34862</h1>
<p>
There are 30 ministers in a parliament. Each two of them are either friends or enemies, and each is friends with exactly six others. Every three ministers form a committee. Find the total number of committees in which all three members are friends or all three are enemies.

<p>

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
How many committees is a minister a member of? In how many committees are the remaining two members the friend and the enemy of the minister?


</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  We denote the ministers by dots. We connect the dots with a red line if the respective ministers are friends and with a blue line if they are enemies.
We need to find the number of single-coloured triangles with vertices at these points. The number of all triangles is equal to <img src="34862.gif">.
<p>
  Let's first count the number of non-coloured triangles. In each such triangle, there are exactly two angles in which the red and blue segments converge $($let's call such angles multi-coloured$)$. In single-coloured triangles there are no multi-coloured corners. In each vertex, by hypothesis, 6 red and 23 blue segments converge, that is, there are $6 \times 23$ = 138 multi-coloured corners with a fixed vertex. The total number of multi-coloured triangles, therefore, is $138 \times 30$/2 = 2070. And the number of single-colour triangles is equal to 4060 - 2070 = 1990.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
1990 committees.
