<h1>Problem ID 78020</h1> <p>
	The segment OA is given. From the end of the segment A there are 5 segments $AB_1, AB_2, AB_3, AB_4, AB_5$. From each point $B_i$ there can be five more new segments or not a single new segment, etc. Can the number of free ends of the constructed segments be 1001? By the free end of a segment we mean a point belonging to only one segment $($except point O$)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
When five segments are drawn from the end of the segment, 5 new free ends appear and one old one disappears. As a result, the number of free ends increases by 4. Therefore, if five of the segments are drawn k times, then the number of free ends is 4k + 1. For k = 250, we get the required number of free ends.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes.
