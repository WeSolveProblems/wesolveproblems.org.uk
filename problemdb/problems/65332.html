<h1>Problem ID 65332</h1>
<p>
Alice has six magic pies in her pocket: two magnifying pies $($if you eat it, you will grow$)$, and two reducing pies $($if you eat it, you will shrink$)$. When Alice met Mary Ann, she, without looking, took out three pies from her pocket and gave them to Mary Ann. Find the probability that one of the girls does not have any magnifying pies.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Of course, one of the girls does have one of the magnifying pies. You need to find the probability that she also has the second magnifying. After the split, this girl, besides the first magnifying pie, has two more pies from the five remaining ones. Hence, the probability that one of the two girls has the second magnifying pie is 2/5.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
0.4.
