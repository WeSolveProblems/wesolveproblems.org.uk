<h1>Problem</h1>
A class contains 25 pupils. It is known that within any group of 3 pupils, there are two friends. Prove that there is a pupil who has no fewer than 12 friends.
<h1>Solution</h1>
Consider two pupils who are not friends with one another (if no such pupils exist, then all of the pupils are friends with one another, so each pupil has 24 friends, and the problem is solved). Let us call these two pupils Alice and Bob. Of the remaining pupils, each is friends with either Alice or Bob. It is true that if someone (for example Charlie) is not friends with Alice or Bob, then we would have a group of three pupils in which there are no friends (a contradiction). If we now assume that neither Alice nor Bob has more than 11 friends, then the total number of other pupils in the class (excluding Alice and Bob) in the class cannot exceed 22 (by the Pigeon Hole Principle). This contradiction proves, that at least one of the pupils has no fewer than 12 friends.
