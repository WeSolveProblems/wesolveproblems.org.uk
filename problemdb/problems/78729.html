<h1>Problem ID 78729</h1>
<p>
In a set there are 100 weights, each two of which differ in mass by no more than 20 g. Prove that these weights can be put on two cups of weighing scales, 50 pieces on each one, so that one cup of weights is lighter than the other by no more than 20 g.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We divide the weights into pairs in an arbitrary way. We put the first pair on different cups of the weighing scales arbitrarily. Then we will consistently place pairs of weights, putting each time the heavier weight on the lighter cup. Suppose that the weights a and a + α lie on the plates, where 0 $≤$ α $≤$ 20, and we put the weights b + β and b, where 0 $≤$ β $≤$ 20. Then the difference in the weights of the loads lying on the cups is | α - β | $≤$ 20.
