<h1>Problem ID 60416</h1> <p>
In the expansion of $(x + y)^n$, using the Newton binomial formula, the second term was 240, the third - 720, and the fourth - 1080. Find x, y and n.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
By the condition $nx^{n-1}y = 240, n (n-1) x^{n-2}y^2 = 2 \times 720, n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3}y^3 = 6 \times 1080$. By dividing the second equation by the first, the third by the second and denoting by t = y / x, we obtain $(n - 1) t = 6, (n - 2) t = 4.5$. Hence t = 1.5, n - 1 = 4. We substitute in the first equation: $5x^5 \times 1.5 = 240$, that is, x = 2, and y = 3.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
x = 2, y = 3, n = 5.
