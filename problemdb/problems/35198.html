<h1>Problem ID 35198</h1>
<p>
A $99 \times 99$ chequered table is given, each cell of which is painted black or white. It is allowed $($at the same time$)$ to repaint all of the cells of a certain column or row in the colour of the majority of cells in that row or column. Is it always possible to have that all of the cells in the table are painted in the same colour?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
If you recolour each of the rows, you get a table, all the rows of which are of the same colour.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
	First, apply the repainting described in the problem to each row of the table. After that, each of the rows consists of cells of the same colour. This, in particular, means that each column has the same number of cells in each colour. Now it is enough to repaint each of the columns - after which all of the columns will be of one colour, and all of them will be painted in the same colour.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes, it is always possible.
