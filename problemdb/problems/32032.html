<h1>Problem ID 32032</h1>
<p>
On a plane, there are 1983 points and a circle of unit radius. Prove that there is a point on the circle, from which the sum of the distances to these points is no less than 1983.
</p>
<h1>Solution </h1>
<p>
Denote the given points as $M_{1}$, $M_{2}$, ..., $M_{1983}$. Consider on the circle two arbitrary diametrically opposite points $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$. According to the triangle inequality, taking into account that $N_{1}N_{2}$ = 2, for each point $M_{i}$, we can write $M_{i}N_{1}$ + $M_{i}N_{2}$ $\geq$ 2. Adding these inequalities, we thus get 

$$\sum_{i=1}^{1983} M_{i}N_{1} + \sum_{i=1}^{1983}M_{i}N_{2} \geq 2 \times 1983 $$ 

 And so at least one of the two sums on the left-hand side of the last inequality equals no less than 1983.
