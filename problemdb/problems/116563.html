<h1>Problem ID 116563</h1>
<p>
Does there exist a real number α such that the number cos α is irrational, and all the numbers cos 2α, cos 3α, cos 4α, cos 5α are rational?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Suppose the contrary. Then the number A = cos α + cos 5α is irrational, as the sum of a rational and an irrational number is irrational. On the other hand,
A = 2 cos 2α cos 3α which is rational as the product of three rational numbers is rational. This gives us a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
No there does not exist.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
If we remove cos 5α from the condition, then the <h1>Answer</h1>  will be different. For example, for α = π / 6, the number cos α is irrational, and the numbers cos 2α, cos 3α, cos 4α are rational. On the other hand, the solution shows that cos 4α can be removed from the condition painlessly.
