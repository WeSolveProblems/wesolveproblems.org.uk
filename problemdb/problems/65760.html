<h1>Problem ID 65760</h1>

Author: A. Glazyrin
<p>
In the coordinate space, all planes with the equations x ± y ± z = n $($for all integers n$)$ were carried out. They divided the space into tetrahedra and octahedra. Suppose that the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ with rational coordinates does not lie in any plane. Prove that there is a positive integer k such that the point $(kx_0, ky_0, kz_0)$ lies strictly inside some octahedron from the partition.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  Lemma. Let the rational numbers a, b, c and a + b + c be non-integers. Then there exists a natural number k such that the numbers ka, kb and kc are non-integers, and
1 $<$ {ka} + {kb} + {kc} $<$ 2.
<p>
  Proof. Replacing the numbers a, b and c by their fractional parts, we can assume that they lie in the interval $(0, 1)$. Denote by f (t) = {ta} + {tb} + {tc}. Note that for 1 $<$ a + b + c $<$ 2 we can set k = 1.
<p>
  Let a + b + c $<$ 1. Choose a natural number m such that ma, mb and mc are integers. Then $f (m - 1) = f (-1) = 3 - (a + b + c)$ $>$ 2. Hence, there is a smallest positive integer k such that $f (k)$ $>$ 1 $($then $f (k - 1)$ ≤ 1$)$. We show that this k satisfies all of the requirements.
<p>
  From the inequality ${ka} ≤ {(k - 1) a} + a$ and analogous ones, we obtain $f (k) ≤ f (k - 1) + (a + b + c) $<$ f (k - 1) + 1 $<$ 2 . (*)$ It remains to show that the numbers ka, kb and kc are non-integers. Suppose that ka is an integer. Then ${ka} = {(k - 1) a} + a – 1$, therefore the estimate $(*)$ can be strengthened: $f (k) ≤ f (k - 1) + (a + b + c) - 1 $<$ f ( k - 1) ≤ 1$. But this contradicts the choice of k.
<p>
  If a + b + c $>$ 2, it suffices to apply the already proved statement to the numbers a '= 1 - a, b' = 1 - b and c '= 1 - c: the number k, suitable for these numbers, is suitable for the initial ones.

  Let us pass to the solution of the problem. In addition to this coordinate space Oxyz, we introduce a new space Oabc. To the point $($x, y, z$)$ from the old space we associate the point $($a, b, c$)$ from the new one with the coordinates a = y + z - x, b = x - y + z, c = x + y - z; then $x = (b + c)/2, y = (a + c)/2, z = (a + b)/2$. Note that x + y + z = a + b + c. Then the partition of the old space corresponds to the partitioning of the new planes of the form a = n, b = n, c = n and a + b + c = n. We set $a_0 = y_0 + z_0 – x_0, b_0 = x_0 – y_0 + z_0, c = x_0 + y_0 – z_0$; by assumption, the numbers $a_0, b_0, c_0$ and $a_0 + b_0 + c_0$ are non-integers.
<p>
  Consider a point $($u, v, w$)$ of a new space with non-integer coordinates. It falls into some cube of the form A ≤ a ≤ A + 1, B ≤ b ≤ B + 1,
C ≤ c ≤ C + 1. This cube intersects two "inclined" planes a + b + c = A + B + C + 1 and a + b + c = A + B + C + 2 that split it into two tetrahedra and into one $($irregular$)$ octahedron. In this case, the point $($u, v, w$)$ gets inside the octahedron if it is in the strip between the indicated planes, that is, if
1 $<$ {u} + {v} + {w} $<$ 2. Hence, applying the lemma to the numbers $a_0, b_0, c_0$, we find the value of k that satisfies the requirements of the problem.
