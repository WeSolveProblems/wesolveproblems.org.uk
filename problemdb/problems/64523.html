<h1>Problem ID 64523</h1>
<p>
A castle is surrounded by a circular wall with nine towers, at which there are knights on duty. At the end of each hour, they all move to the neighbouring towers, each knight moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise. During the night, each knight stands for some time at each tower. It is known that there was an hour when at least two knights were on duty at each tower, and there was an hour when there was precisely one knight on duty on each of exactly five towers. Prove that there was an hour when there were no knights on duty on one of the towers.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Imagine that the knights stand on 18 squares, located on two circular platforms, and which each hour they turn in opposite directions by 40$^{\circ}$. According to the question, at some point there was no one on five of the sites, and on the corresponding sites $($in the same towers$)$ there was one knight. Let us examine two cases.
</p>
1$)$ There are empty squares on both platforms. Then at some point they will be in the same tower, that is, there will be no knights on this tower.
</p>
2$)$ All empty platforms are on the same platform, and all the lone knights are on the other. Since there are only 9 $<$ 5 + 5 towers, at each moment there is a tower, where there will be both an empty square and a lone knight. But this contradicts the question.
