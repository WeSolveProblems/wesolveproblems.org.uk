<h1>Problem ID 104072</h1>
<p>
On Brennanâ€™s birthday, the postman Daniel wants to find out how old Brennan is. Sarah says that Brennan is over 11 years old, and Matt claims that he is more than 10 years old. How old is Brennan, if it is known that exactly one of them was mistaken? Justify your answer.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Note that if Sarah was not mistaken, then neither was Matt, which contradicts the condition. Hence, Sarah told a lie unlike Matt. Thus, Brennan is more than 10 years old, but not more than 11. Therefore, Brennan turned 11.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
Brennan is 11 years old.
