<h1>Problem ID 88226</h1>
<p>
On the street, four girls are talking in a circle: Anna, Katya, Galina and Nina. The girl in the green dress $($not Anna and not Katya$)$ stands between the girl in the blue dress and Nina. The girl in the white dress stands between the girl in the pink dress and Katya. What colour dress was each girl wearing?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Remember tasks 71, 132, 144, 189.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since the girl in the green dress is not Anna, not Katya and not Nina, only Galina remains. Katya is not in the green, white or pink dress, hence she is wearing a blue dress. So: Galina stands between Katya and Nina, which means that Anna also stands between Katya and Nina. That is, the girls stand like this: Galina $($in green$)$, Katya $($in blue$)$, Anna, Nina. Hence, from the condition that the girl in the white dress stands between the girl in the pink dress and Katya, it follows that Anna is in the white dress, and Nina is in the pink dress.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	Anna wears a white dress, Katya a blue dress, Galina – green and Nina – pink.
