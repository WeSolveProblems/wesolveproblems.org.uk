<h1>Problem ID 103833</h1>
<p>
On the island of Contrast, both knights and liars live. Knights always tell the truth, liars always lie. Some residents said that the island has an even number of knights, and the rest said that the island has an odd number of liars. Can the number of inhabitants of the island be odd?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
If two residents of the island said the same thing, then they are either both liars or both knights.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
It is clear that if two people made the same statement, then they are either both liars or both knights.
Since there is at least one liar and at least one knight on the island, either all the knights made the first statement, and all liars made the second, or vice versa. In the first case, there is both an even number of knights and liars, and in the second one, there is an odd number of both. So, the number of people on the island is even.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
No there can not be.
