<h1>Problem ID 30447</h1>
<p>
In each square of an 11x11 board there is a checker. Consider the game with two players where: in one move a player is allowed to take any amount of adjacent checkers from the board, as long as they checkers are in the same vertical column or in the same horizontal row. The winner is the player who removes the last checker. Which player wins the game?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first player wins. In their first turn they remove the central checker, and then for the rest of the turns they play using a central-symmetric strategy.
