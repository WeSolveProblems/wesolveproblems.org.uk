<h1>Problem ID 65274</h1>
<p>
On a roulette, any number from 0 to 2007 can be determined with the same probability. The roulette is spun time after time. Let $P_k$ denote the probability that at some point the sum of the numbers that are determined by a ball being thrown on the roulette is k. Which number is larger: $P_{2007}$ or $P_{2008}$?

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
   Since before the game starts the sum is zero, then $P_0$ = 1.
   Reasoning in the same way as in problem number 65273 $($there is one difference: instead of the number 6, we have the number 2008$)$, we have:
$P_{2007} – P_{2008} = 1/2008 (P_{2007} + P_{2006} + ... + P_0) - 1/2008 (P_{2008} + P_{2007} + ... + P_1) = 1/2008 (P_0 – P_{2008})> 0$, since $P_{2008}$ $<$1 $($the sum 2008, obviously, cannot occur$)$.

</p> 
<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
$P_{2007}$.
