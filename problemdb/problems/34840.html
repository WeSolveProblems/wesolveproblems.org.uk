<h1>Problem ID 34840</h1>
<p>
 Several guests are sitting at a round table. Some of them are familiar with each other; mutually acquainted. All the acquaintances of any guest $($counting himself$)$ sit around the table at regular intervals. $($For another person, these gaps may be different.$)$ It is known that any two have at least one common acquaintance. Prove that all guests are familiar with each other.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
In the beginning, prove that there is a person familiar with all the others.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Note that if a person has acquaintances sitting next to him $($in particular, if he is familiar with his neighbor$)$, then this person is familiar with all. Let us prove that there is such a guest. Let A and B be two neighbors. If they are not familiar with each other, then their mutual friend C is familiar with everyone, since his acquaintances are sitting without gaps. In the opposite case, all people are familiar with person A $($for the same reason$)$. So, let X be a guest familiar with all. Then his neighbors are also familiar with everyone, since they are familiar with X $($who is their neighbor$)$. Neighbors of these neighbors are also familiar with all, and so on in a circle in both directions.
