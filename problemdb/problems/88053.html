<h1>Problem ID 88053</h1>
<p>
Using five eights, arithmetic operations and exponentiation, form the numbers from 1 to 20.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to write a formula which, when you insert any five identical digits into it, you get 1.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
When solving these problems, some general considerations can be used. For example, the number 2 can be represented in the form $($m/m$)$ + $(m/m)^m$, where m is any number $($in our case, from 2 to 9$)$. We also note that if the number k can be represented using only 3 digits m, then the numbers k - 1, k, k + 1 can be represented by subtracting, multiplying or adding the obtained three-digit number and m/m.
