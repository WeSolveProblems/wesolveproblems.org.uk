<h1>Problem ID 88142</h1>
<p>
Find the largest six-digit number, for which each digit, starting with the third, is equal to the sum of the two previous digits.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Notice, when two numbers have the same number of digits, then there will one which has a greater first digit.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If the first digit was a, and the second digit was b, then the third one would be $($a + b$)$, the fourth one would be $($a + 2b$)$, the fifth one would be $($2a + 3b$)$, the sixth one would be $($3a + 5b$)$. We need to find the maximum possible value of a, so that the sixth digit remains a "number", i.e. so that the inequality 3a + 5b $<$ 10 holds. This is possible for a = 3, b = 0, i.e. the required number will be 303369.
</p> 

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
303369.
