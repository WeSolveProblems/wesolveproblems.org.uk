<p>
Prove that

</p> <h1>Solution 1</h1> <p>
<img src="30712 2.png">  
 -
Is the number of "even" subsets of a set of n elements, and
  <img src="30712 3.png">
 is the number of "odd" subsets. These quantities are equal $($ see Solution 1 of problem number 30711 
$)$.

</p> <h1>Solution 2</h1> <p>
The sum of the numbers standing in even places in the n-th row of Pascal's triangle is equal to the sum of the numbers at odd places in the same line. Indeed, suppose that in the previous line there are the numbers $c_0$, $c_1$, ..., $c_{n-1}$. Then on the even places of the n-th line there are the numbers $c_0$, $c_1$ + $c_2$, $c_3$ + $c_4$, ...; their sum is equal to $c_0$ + $c_1$ + ... + $c_{n-1}$. And at odd places there are the numbers $c_0$ + $c_1$, $c_2$ + $c_3$, $c_4$ + $c_5$, ... with the same sum.
