<h1>Problem ID 116842</h1>
<p>
Going to school, Michael found everything he needed under the pillow, under the sofa, on the table or under the table. The items he needed to find were a notebook, a cheat sheet, an mp3 player and sneakers. Under the table, he did not find a notebook or an mp3 player. His cheat sheet never lies on the floor. The mp3 player was neither on the table nor under the sofa. What was lying where, if there was only one object in each of the places?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The mp3 player was found not under the table, not on the table or under the sofa. So it was under the pillow. Therefore, the cheat sheet could not lie under the pillow. But it did not lie on the floor $($that is, it was neither under the table, nor under the sofa$)$. Consequently, it was lying on the table. The notebook did not lie under the table, it means that it could only lie under the sofa. Then under the table there could only be sneakers.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
The notebook was under the sofa, the cheat sheet was on the table, the mp3 player was under the pillow, and the sneakers were under the table.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
A different order of reasoning is also possible, in which the sneakers are first located, and then the mp3 player.
