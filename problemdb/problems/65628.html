<h1>Problem ID 65628</h1>
<p>
A group of children from two classes came to an after school club: Jack, Ben, Fred, Louis, Claudia, Janine and Charlie. To the question: "How many of your classmates are here?" everyone honestly answered with either "Two" or "Three". But the boys thought that they were only being asked about the boy classmates, and the girls correctly understood that they were asking about everyone. Is Charlie a boy or a girl?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The sex of each child, except for Charlie, is determined by the names unequivocally, so the number of boys in the club is either 4 or 5.
Suppose that some boys are in different classes. Then their answers show that at least three boys from each class came to the club. This gives a contradiction. Consequently, all the boys present are classmates, but then there could not be five of them. So, Charlie is a girl.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
A Girl.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
The described situation is possible: four boys study in one class, and the three girls in another. In this case, each boy gave the answer "Three", and each girl - "Two."
