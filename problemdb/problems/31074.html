<h1>Problem ID 31074</h1>
<p>
Out of a whole 100-vertex graph, 98 edges were removed. Prove that the remaining ones were connected.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suppose that the resulting graph turns out to be disconnected, and in one of the connected components there are n vertices. Then at least n $(100 - n)$ edges connecting the vertices of this component with the vertices of the other components, were removed. But n $(100 - n)$ = 50² - $(n - 50)$² $≥$ 50² - 49² = $1 \times 99$ $>$ 98. This gives us a contradiction.

In a country, each two cities are connected with a one-way road.
Prove that there is a city from which you can drive to any other whilst travelling along no more than two roads.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
This is the city from which the largest number of roads come out.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Consider the city A, from which the largest number of roads come out, and an arbitrary city B. If there is a road  which leads from A to B, then everything is in order. If the road leads from B to A, then since B has no more roads coming out of it than A does, then there is a city C, into which the road from A leads, but to which the road from B does not lead. Then you can get from A to B along the route ACB.
