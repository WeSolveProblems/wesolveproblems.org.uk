<h1>Problem ID 31074</h1>
<p>
Out of a whole 100-vertex graph, 98 edges were removed. Prove that the remaining ones were connected.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suppose that the resulting graph turns out to be disconnected, and in one of the connected components there are n vertices. Then at least n $(100 - n)$ edges connecting the vertices of this component with the vertices of the other components, were removed. But n $(100 - n)$ = 50² - $(n - 50)$² $≥$ 50² - 49² = $1 \times 99$ $>$ 98. This gives us a contradiction.
