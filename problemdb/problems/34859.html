<h1>Problem ID 34859</h1>
<p>
12 candidates for mayor talked about themselves. After a while, one said: "before me once did someone lie" Another said: "And now-twice." "And now - thrice" - said the third, and so on until the 12th, who said: "And now 12 times someone has lied." Then the presenter interrupted the discussion. It turned out that at least one candidate correctly counted how many times someone had lied before him. So how many times have the candidates lied?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Suppose the first candidate lied.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Suppose the first candidate lied. This means that before the statement, the number of false statements was not equal to 1. After his statement, this number increased by 1, so it was not equal to 2. Consequently, the second candidate also lied. Continuing the same arguments, we get that all the candidates lied, and this contradicts the condition of the problem. So, the first candidate told the truth. Thus, both before and after his statement the number of false statements was equal to 1. Therefore, the second candidate lied. Further, arguing similarly we get that all the subsequent ones also lied. So, all the candidates, except the first one, lied, and one more lie sounded before the described discussion. Therefore, in all the candidates lied 12 times.
