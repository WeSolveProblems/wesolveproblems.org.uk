<h1>Problem ID 115374</h1>
<p>
In Neverland, only elves and gnomes live. Gnomes lie about their gold, but in any other instances they tell the truth. Elves lie when talking about gnomes, but in other instances they tell the truth. One day two neverlandians said:
<p>
A: All my gold I stole from the Dragon.
<p>
B: You're lying
<p>
Determine whether each of them is an elf or a gnome
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Suppose that A is an elf. Then he told the truth, and B lied. But neither gnomes nor elves lie when talking about elves. Hence, A is a gnome. When speaking about gold, he lied. So what B said about A is the truth, which could only be done by a gnome.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Both gnomes.
