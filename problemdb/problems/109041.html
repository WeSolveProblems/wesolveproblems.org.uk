<h1>Problem ID 109041</h1>
<p>
$x_1$ is the real root of the equation $x^2$ + ax + b = 0, $x_2$ is the real root of the equation $x^2$ - ax - b = 0.
Prove that the equation $x^2$ + 2ax + 2b = 0 has a real root, enclosed between $x_1$ and $x_2$. $($ a and b are real numbers $)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
See problem number 77989.
