<h1>Problem ID 35295</h1>
<p>
  On every cell of a $9 \times 9$ board there is a beetle. At the sound of a whistle, every beetle crawls onto one of the diagonally neighbouring cells. Note that, in some cells, there may be more than one beetle, and some cells will be unoccupied.
Prove that there will be at least 9 unoccupied cells.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Paint every over vertical of the board in black and the rest in white. Then the beetle will crawl from a  black cell to a white, and vice versa.

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let's paint every over vertical of the board in black and the rest in white. As a result, $5 \times 9$ = 45 cells $(_5 verticals_)$ will be painted in black and only 36 cells in white. Note that from a black cell the beetle can only creep onto a white cell, and from a white cell only to a black one. Consequently, after the beetles crawled onto diagonally neighbouring cells, there were 36 beetles on 45 black cells. Hence, at least 9 black cells were not occupied.
