<h1>Problem ID 78615</h1>
<p>
Four lamps need to be hung over a square ice-rink so that they fully illuminate it. What is the minimum height needed at which to hang the lamps if each lamp illuminates a circle of radius equal to the height at which it hangs?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Answer: at the height of $\frac{a}{2 $sqrt2$ }$ , where a is the side of the square. Letâ€™s consider the following 5 points: the vertices of the square and its centre. If the diameter of the circle is less than $ {\ frac {a} {\ sqrt {2}}} $, then it can contain no more than one of these points. Therefore, 4 circles of radius less than $ {\ frac {a} {\ sqrt {2}}} $ cannot completely cover a square with side a. It is easy to see that 4 circles, whose diameters are the segments connecting the centre of the square with its vertices, completely cover the square.
