<h1>Problem ID 64933</h1>
<p>
Find all of the solutions of the puzzle: ARKA + RKA + KA + A = 2014. (Different letters correspond to different numbers, and the same letters correspond to the same numbers.)

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Since in the word ARKA there are A thousands, then A = 1 or 2. In addition, A + A + A + A ends in a 4, therefore A = 1. Since K + K + K ends in a 1, then K = 7. Since R + R + 2 = 10, then R = 4.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
1471 + 471 + 71 + 1 = 2014.
