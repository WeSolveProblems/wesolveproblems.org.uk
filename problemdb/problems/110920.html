<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  Peter has some coins in his pocket. If Peter removes 3 coins from his pocket without looking, there will always be a £1 coin among them. If Peter removes 4 coins from his pocket without looking, there will always be a £2 coin among them. Peter removes 5 coins from his pocket. Identify these coins.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Since in any 3 drawn coins there will be a £1 coin present, there must be no more than two coins of another value present. That is, all of Peter's coins apart from at most two are £1 coins. The fact that in any 4 drawn coins there will always be a £2 coin present means that there can be no more than 3 coins that are not £2 coins present in his pocket. Therefore within the 5 coins Peter removes from his pocket there will be 3 £1 coins and 2 £2 coins. But $2+3=5$ so all of the coins have been accounted for and identified. Notice that we have identified (even though this is not required by the question) exactly how many coins were present in Peter's pocket. Indeed this exact combination of coins must be present (if the rules given are established).

<p>
  In other words, adding any other coin to his pocket (be that an extra £1 or £2 or something else) would give the possibility of removing 5 coins different that are different to those found. Therefore no other coins, other than those identified can be present in Peter's pocket if the parameters given in the question are to be satisfied.

  £1 £1 £1 £2 £2
