<h1>Problem ID 88201</h1>
<p>
It is known that "copper" coins that are worth 1, 2, 3, 5 pence weigh 1, 2, 3, 5 g respectively. Among the four "copper" coins $($one for each denomination$)$, there is one defective coin, differing in weight from the normal ones. How can the defective coin be determined using scales without weights?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to do this in two weighings: for the first one, put the coins worth 2 and 3 pence on one side of the scales, and on the other side - 5 pence; for the second weighing put the coins worth 1 and 2 pence on one side of the scales, and on the other – the 3 pence coin.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We make two weighings. For the first one, put the coins worth 2 and 3 pence on one side of the scales, and on the other side - 5 pence. For the second weighing put the coins worth 1 and 2 pence on one side of the scales, and on the other – the 3 pence coin. In this case, four options are possible.
<p>
1.	If, suddenly, all of the coins are not defective - the scales will be in equilibrium for both weighings.
<p>
2.	If the defective coin is worth 1 pence, during the first weighing the scales will be in equilibrium, while the second they will not be.
<p>
3.	If the defective is a coin worth 5 pence, the scales will be balanced for the second time, but not for the first time.
<p>
4.	If both times the scales are not in equilibrium, then the defective coin is either worth 2 pence or 3 pence. Then the result of the first weighing will show us whether the defective coin is heavier or lighter than the real ones, and the result of the second weighing will determine this coin.
