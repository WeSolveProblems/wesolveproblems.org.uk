<h1>Problem ID 65303</h1>
<p>
 A numerical set $x_1, ..., x_n$ is given. Consider the function <IMG SRC="65303 1.png">.
<p>
a)	Is it true that the function d $($t$)$ takes the smallest value at a single point, for any set of numbers $x_1, ..., x_n$?
<p>
  b) Compare the values of d $($c$)$ and d $($m$)$, where <IMG SRC="65303 2.png">, and m is the median of the specified set.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
a)	Let's consider the assortment of numbers {2, 4, 7, 11}. We construct the function d $($t$)$ for this assortment. First, we construct graphs of the functions y = | x - 2 |, y = | x - 4 |, y = | x - 7 |, y = | x - 11 |.
<p>
  Now we construct the graphs of the function <IMG SRC="65303 3.png"> $($in red$)$ and <IMG SRC="65303 4.png"> $($in green$)$.
<p>

<p>
  We plot the function y = d $($t$)$ in orange. This is easy to do if at each point, we take the middle of the vertical segment connecting the green and red graphs. This graph has kinks at all of the points where there is a kink in the graph of the function <IMG SRC="65303 6.png">. Moreover, the function y = d $($t$)$, obviously, cannot increase where the function <IMG SRC="65303 7.png"> decreases and cannot decrease where this function increases.
<p>

<p>
  It can be seen that the function y = d $($t$)$ takes the minimum value at more than one point, and does so at each point in the interval [6.5; 7].
<p>
  b) It follows from the above argument that the function y = d $($t$)$ cannot increase to the left of c and cannot decrease to the right of this point. Hence, $d (c) â‰¤ d (t)$ for any t, in particular for t = m.
