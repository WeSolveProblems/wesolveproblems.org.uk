<h1>Problem ID 34976</h1>
<p>
 Two people toss a coin: one tosses it 10 times, the other - 11 times.
What is the probability that the second person’s coin showed heads more times than the first?

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
The events "the second coin shows heads more than the first" and "the second person’s coin shows tails more than the first’s" are, obviously, equiprobable. But they also complement each other $($since the second person tossed the coin exactly one time more than the first, there are either more heads or tails, but not both$)$. Therefore, the probability of each event is ½.

</p> 
<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
½.

</p> 
<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
Years 7-8 - 10 marks, years 9-10 - 7 marks.
