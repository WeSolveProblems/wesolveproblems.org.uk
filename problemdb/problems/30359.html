<h1>Problem ID 30359</h1>
<p>
Prove that the product of any three consecutive natural numbers is divisible by 6.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Show that one of the factors is divisible by 2 and one of the factors is divisible by 3.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Among these three numbers there is at least one even number.Hence, in the decomposition of the product into prime factors there is a factor of 2.
<p>
Among these three numbers, one number is divisible by 3. Hence, in the decomposition of a product into prime factors there is a factor 3.
<p>
In the decomposition of the product into prime factors there are the prime numbers 2 and 3. Hence, it is divisible by their product, that is, by 6.
