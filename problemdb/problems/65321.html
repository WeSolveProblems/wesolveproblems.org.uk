<h1>Problem ID 65321</h1>
<p>
Condition
The point O, lying inside the triangle ABC, is connected by segments with the vertices of the triangle. Prove that the variance of the set of angles AOB, AOC and BOC is less than
<p>
  a) $10π^2/27$;
<p>
  b) $2π^2/9$.
</p>

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
  We arrange the indicated angles in descending order: $α \geq β \geq γ$.
<p>
a)	α + β + γ 2π, therefore the average value is 2π/3. Obviously, each angle is smaller than π, and $γ \leq 2π/3$. Hence, $D <1/3 (π^2 + π^2 + 2π/3) - (2π/3)^2 = 10π^2/27$.
<p>
  b) It is clear that $α \geq 2π/3$. Since α $<$ π, then β + γ $>$ π, therefore β $>$ π/2. From these inequalities, we obtain $0 \leq α - 2π/3 < π / 3, - π/6 < β - 2π/3 < π/3$,
$-2π/3 < γ - 2π/3 \leq 0$.
  Therefore, D = 1/3 $((α-2π/3)^2 + (β-2π/3)^2 + (γ-2π/3)^2) < 1/3 ((π/3)^2 + (π/3)^2 + (2π/3)^2) = 2π^2/9$.
