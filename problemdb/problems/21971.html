<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A forest contains a million fir trees. It is known that any given tree has at most 600,000 needles. Prove that there will be two trees with the same number of needles.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Consider the pigeonhole principle, where pigeons are fitted into roosting holes. Here we have trees that need to fit the numbers of needles they have. We have 600,001 combination of needles on any one tree numbered from 0 to 600,000. Each fir tree is placed in the group equal to the number of needles on the tree. Since there are significantly more trees than needle-numbers, in at least one of the groups there will be at least two trees. If there was at most one tree in each group, there would be at most 600,001 of them. There are more than 600,001 trees so by definition they must be two or more with the same number of needles. </p>
