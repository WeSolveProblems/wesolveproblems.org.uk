<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A forest contains a million fir trees. It is known that a given tree has at most 600 000 needles. Prove that there will be two trees with the same number of needles.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Consider the trees as 'rabbits'. We then have 600 001 hutches, numbered from 0 to 600 000. Each 'rabbit' (fir tree) is placed in a hutch with the number equal to the number of needles on the tree. Since there are significantly more 'rabbits' than hutches, in at least one of the 'hutches' there will be at least two 'rabbits'. If there was at most one 'rabbit' in each 'hutch', there could be at most 600 001 of them. However if there are two 'rabbits' in one 'hutch', then by definition they have the same number of needles. </p>
