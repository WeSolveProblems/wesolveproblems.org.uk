<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A forest contains a million fir trees. It is known that any given tree has at most 600,000 needles. Prove that there will be two trees with the same number of needles.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Consider the trees as 'pigeons' and the needles as 'roosting holes'. We have 600,001 roosting holes numbered from 0 to 600,000. Each pigeon (fir tree) is placed in a hole where the number is equal to the number of needles on the tree. Since there are significantly more pigeons than holes, in at least one of the holes there will be at least two pigeons. If there was at most one pigeon in each hole, there would be at most 600,001 of them. There are more than 600,001 trees so by definition they must be two or more with the same number of needles. </p>
