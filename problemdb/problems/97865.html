<h1>Problem ID 97865</h1>
<p>
a$)$ Give an example of a positive number a such that {a} + {1 / a} = 1.
<p>
b$)$ Can such an a be a rational number?
 
</p>
<h1>Solution 1</h1>
<p>
a$) lets denote a as a = 2 + $\sqrt{3}$. Since $(2 + \sqrt{3})$ $(2 - \sqrt{3})$ = 1, {a} + {1/a} = $(\sqrt{3} – 1)$ + $(2 - \sqrt{3})$ = 1
<p> 
b$)$ Assume that the number a is rational, and we represent it in the form of an irreducible fraction: a = m / n. If {a} + {1 / a} = 1, then, obviously,
a + 1 / a is an integer; we denote it by k. So, m / n + n / m = k, that is, $m^2$ + $n^2$ = kmn. It follows that $m^2$ is divisible by n, and $n^2$ is divisible by m, and since m and n are relatively prime, this is possible only for | m | = | n | = 1, that is, for a = ± 1. But in this case {a} + {1 / a} = 0. Which is a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Solution 2</h1>
It follows from the condition that a + 1 / a is an integer, but for an irreducible fraction a = p / q this is impossible: the fraction is also irreducible.   
Thus, equality holds if and only if a + 1 / a is an integer n, and a is not an integer. Since the equation $a^2$ - na + 1 = 0 for n $>$ 2 can not have rational roots $($see problem 61013$)$, the answer in part b is negative.
As an example $($ part a $)$, it is only necessary to solve this equation, for example, for n = 3.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
a$)$ For example, a = 2 + $\sqrt{3}$. b$)$ It can not.
