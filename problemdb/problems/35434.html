<h1>Problem ID 35434</h1>
<p>
Three people are talking at dinner: Greyson, Blackburne and Reddick. The black-haired person told Greyson: "It is curious that one of us is grey-haired, the other is black-haired, and the third is red-haired, but no one has hair colour that matches their surname." What colour hair does each of the men chatting have?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Make a table.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
</p>
The first solution
<p>
To solve the problem, we can use a $3 \times 3$ table. By the condition of the problem Greyson is not grey-haired, Blackburne is not dark-haired, and Reddick is not red-haired. This allows us to put a minus sign in the corresponding cells of the table. In addition, Greyson is not dark-haired, and so in the cell that intersects the Greyson line and the dark-haired column, we can also put a minus sign. From the table, it follows that Greyson can only be red-haired. Let’s put a plus sign in the corresponding cell. Hence it is clear that Blackburne is not red-haired. We can denote this by a minus sign in the table. Now it is clear that Blackburne can only be grey-haired, and Reddick is dark-haired. Using the table helps to clearly visualise the solution of the problem.

The second solution
<p>
We can represent the elements of each of the sets by points on a plane. If, by the condition of the problem, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of these sets, then we will connect those elements of the sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a solid line and if there is no such correspondence then we will connect this with a dashed line. Using the condition of the problem, we can get an intuitive image of the initial data on a graph, and then, through logical reasoning, establish the necessary one-to-one correspondence between the remaining elements of these sets. We will graphically represent two sets $($a set of surnames and a set of hair colours$)$. Using the condition of the problem, we connect the following pairs of elements with dashed lines: Blackburne - black, Greyson - grey, Reddick - red and Greyson - black. After this, obviously, it is necessary to connect the following pairs of elements successively with solid lines: Greyson – red-haired, Blackburne - grey-haired, Reddick – black-haired.
