<h1>Problem ID 79639</h1>
<p>
  A carpet of size 4m by 4m has had 15 holes made in it by a moth. Is it always possible to cut out a 1m x 1m area of carpet that doesn't contain any holes? The holes are considered to be points.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Divide the carpet into 16 squares of size 1m x 1m. Since there are 15 holes, or points, it is always true that at least one square will not contain any holes.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  Yes.
