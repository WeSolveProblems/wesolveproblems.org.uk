<h1>Problem ID 57260</h1>
<p>
Two segments AB and A'B' are given on a plane. Construct the point O so that the triangles AOB and Aâ€™OB' are similar $($the same letters denote the corresponding vertices of similar triangles$)$.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We need to construct a point O for which AO: A'O = AB: A'B 'and BO: B'O = AB: A'B'. Point O is a point of intersection of the geometric points of X for which AX: A'X = AB: A'B ', and geometric points of Y, for which BY: B'Y = AB: A'B'.
