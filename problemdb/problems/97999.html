<h1>Problem ID 97999</h1>
<p>
What figure should I put in place of the "?" in the number 888 ... 88? 99 ... 999 $($ eights and nines are written 50 times each $)$ so that it is divisible by 7?
  
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Note that the number 111111 is divisible by 7, so 48 eights can be dropped from the front, and 48 nines from the end. Thus, the problem has been reduced to the same problem but for the number 88? 99. Subtracting an even multiple of 7 - 84049, we find that the number 4? 5 should be divisible by 7. Finally, subtracting 399, we obtain that ?6 is a multiple of 7. Hence ? = 5.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
5.
