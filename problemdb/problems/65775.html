<h1>Problem ID 65775</h1>
<p>
In a convex polygon, which has an odd number of vertices equal to 2n + 1, two independently of each other random diagonals are chosen.
Find the probability that these diagonals intersect inside the polygon.

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
  In total, in the $($2n + 1$)$ â€“gon, there are <img src="65775 1.png">
diagonals, and, consequently, the number of pairs of diagonals is <img src="65775 2.png">

<p>
  Two intersecting diagonals are uniquely determined by the choice of four vertices, hence, the number of ways to choose two intersecting diagonals is <img src="65775 3.png">

<p>
  Diagonals are chosen randomly, so all combinations are equally possible. Hence, the probability that two random diagonals intersect is equal to <img src="65775 4.png">

<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
With increasing n, the probability is approximately 1/3. There is an assumption that if we take an ellipse or a circle and raise the question of the probability of crossing two random chords, the answer must be 1/3. Unfortunately, everything is not so simple. It is important how the random chords are chosen, because the chord of the circle is infinitely large, in contrast to the diagonals of the polygon. You can do this, for example, in this way: in some random way we choose four points A, B, C and D on the circle, independently of each other. What is the probability that the chords AB and CD intersect? Here the answer is really 1/3. You can try to prove it.
