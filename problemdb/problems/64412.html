<h1>Problem ID 64412</h1>
<p>
Prove that the polynomial P $(x)$ = $a_0$ + $a_1x$ + ... + $a_nx^n$ has a number -1 which is a root of multiplicity m + 1 if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:
<p>
$a_0$ - $a_1$ + $a_2$ - $a_3$ + ... + $(-1)^{n}a_n$ = 0,
<p>
- $a_1$ + $2a_2$ - $3a_3$ + ... + $(-1)^{n}na_n$ = 0,
<p>
...
<p>
- $a_1 + 2^{m}a_2 - 3^{m}a_3 + ... + (-1)^{n}n^{m}a_n$ = 0.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let us reformulate the assertion:
the polynomial P $(x)$ = $a_0$ + $a_{1}x$ + ... + $a_{n}x^n$ has a number -1 which is a root of multiplicity m + 1 if and only if $f (0)a_0 - f(1)a_1 + ... + (-1)^{n} f(n)a_n = 0$, $(*)$ for each polynomial f of degree at most m.
<p>
We prove it by induction on m. The base $(m = 0)$ is obvious.
<p>
Inductive step. The number -1 is a root of multiplicity m + 1 if and only if it is a root of multiplicity m and $P^(m)$ $(-1)$ = 0. The first by the induction hypothesis is equivalent to the fact that $(*)$ holds for all polynomials f of degree no greater than m - 1. 
<p>
The second is equivalent to the equality $g(0)a_0$ - g$(1)a_1$ + ... + $(-1)^{n}g(n)a_n$ = 0, where g$(k)$ = k $(k - 1)$ ... $(k - m + 1)$ = $k^m$ + h$(k)$, h$(k)$ is a polynomial of degree m - 1. Since $(*)$ holds for the polynomials g and h, it holds for the polynomial $k^m$ = g$(k)$ - h$(k)$, and hence for any polynomial f of degree at most m.
