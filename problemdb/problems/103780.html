<h1>Problem ID 103780</h1>
<p>
  In any group of 10 children, out of a total of 60 pupils, there will be three who are in the same class. Will it always be the case that amongst the 60 pupils there will be:
</p>
<p>
  1) 15 classmates?
</p>
<p>
  2) 16 classmates?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  a) Divide the 60 pupils into groups of classmates. If no class of 15 or more pupils exists, then each group contains no more than 14 pupils. Let $k$ equal the number of groups, containing two or more pupils. We shall call these groups "big" groups.
</p>
<p>
  The first condition of the problem means than $ k \leq 4$, otherwise by taking two pupils from 5 big groups we could get a group of 10 pupils that doesn't contain 3 classmates. Then we consider two cases:
</p>
<p>
  1.  $ k \leq 3$. This means the total number of schoolchildren in 'big' groups does not exceed $14 \times 3 = 42$ Therefore there are 18 children that do not belong to a 'big' group, so do not have a single classmate. This is a contradiction.
</p>
<p>
  2. k=4 In this case, the total number of schoolchildren in 'big' groups does not exceed 56. Therefore there are 4 children that do not have a single classmate. By taking these 4, and two from each of the 'big' groups, we can form a group of 12 schoolchildren that does not contain 3 classmates. This is a contradiction.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore yes, there will always be 15 classmates amongst the 60 schoolchildren.
</p>
<p>
  b) No, for example 4 classes, each containing 15 schoolchildren.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  a) yes b) no.
