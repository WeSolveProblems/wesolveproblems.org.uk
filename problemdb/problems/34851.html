<h1>Problem</h1>
15 MPs take part in a debate. In their contribution to the debate, each one critcises exactly $k$ of the 14 other contributors. For what minimum value of $k$ is it possible to definitively state that there will be two MPs who have criticised one another?
<h1>Hint</h1>
Consider a diagram where the vertices of a polygon represent an MP and a line between $A$ and $B$ indicates that MP $A$ criticised MP $B$.

<h1>Solution</h1>
If each MP criticises 8 others, then the number of lines drawn on the diagram suggested in the hint would be $15 \times 8 = 120$ which is greater than the number of pairs $^{15}C_{2} = 105$ of vertices. This means, that some pair of vertices has at least two lines linking them, that is, there are two MPs who criticised one another.
On the other hand, let 15 MPs be sitting around a round table. Each one criticses the next 7 people sitting next to him in a clockwise direction. It is clear to see, that in this situation no two MPs criticise one another.

<h1>Answer</h1>
When $k=8$
