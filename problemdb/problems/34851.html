<h1>Problem 34851</h1>
<p>15 MPs take part in a debate. During the debate, each one criticises exactly $k$ of the 14 other contributors. For what minimum value of $k$ is it possible to definitively state that there will be two MPs who have criticised one another?</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>Consider a diagram where the vertices of a polygon represent an MP, and a line between $A$ and $B$ indicates that MP $A$ criticised MP $B$.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>If each MP criticises 8 others, then the number of lines drawn on the diagram suggested in the hint would be $15 \times 8 = 120$ which is greater than the number of pairs of vertices $^{15}C_{2} = 105$. This means that some pair of vertices have at least two lines linking them, that is there are two MPs who criticised one another.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let 15 MPs be sitting around a round table. Each one criticises the next 7 people sitting next to them in a clockwise direction. It is clear to see that in this situation no two MPs criticise one another.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>When $k=8$</p>
