<h1>Problem ID 61002</h1>
<p>
Prove that any polynomial P $(x)$ of degree n can be uniquely expanded in powers of x-c:
P $(x)$ = 
 <img src="61002 1.png">
$c_k$ $(x - c)^k$,
and the coefficients $c_k$ can be found from
$c_k$ =  <img src="61002 .png">

 
 <img src="61002 3.png">

 $(0 \geq k \geq n)$.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
The existence of an expansion is proved by the multiple division by x-c with a remainder.
Uniqueness follows from the above formula for the coefficients, which is verified by direct differentiation.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Nothing to translate.
