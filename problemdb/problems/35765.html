<h1>Problem ID 35765</h1>
<p>
Prove that there is no polyhedron that has exactly seven edges.



<p>

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
From each vertex of the polyhedron at least three edges emerge.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If a polyhedron has four vertices, then it is a tetrahedron with six edges. Let the number of vertices of the polyhedron, n, be at least five. At each vertex of the polyhedron, at least three faces converge, and in this way, at least three edges emerge from each vertex of the polyhedron. Hence, the total number of edges is not less than 3n/2 $>$ 7.
