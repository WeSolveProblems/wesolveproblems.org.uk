<h1>Problem ID 65283</h1>
<p>
In a box of 2009 socks there are blue and red socks. Can there be some number of blue socks that the probability of pulling out two socks of the same colour at random is equal to 0.5?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Let there be m + n socks in the box, of which m are of one color and n of the other. Then the probability of pulling two socks of the same color is equal to the sum of the probabilities of pulling out two socks of the first or two of the second colour:

If this number is equal to ½, then 2m² + 2n² - 2 $($m + n$)$ = m² + 2mn + n² - $($m + n$)$ ⇔ $($m - n$)$² = m + n = 2009. But the number 2009 is not an exact square.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
It is not possible.
