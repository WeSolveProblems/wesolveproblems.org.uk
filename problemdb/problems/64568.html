<h1>Problem ID 64568</h1>
<p>
Hannah placed 101 counters in a row which had values of 1, 2 and 3 points. It turned out that there was at least one counter between every two one point counters, at least two counters lie between every two two point counters, and at least three counters lie between every two three point counters. How many three point counters could Hannah have?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Consider four counters lying in a row. By condition, among them there can not be more than one three-point counter, more than two two-point counters and more than two one point counters. If in this case there are two two-point counters in the four, then between them there are two counters, one of which is a three-point counter: the one point counters can not lie beside each other. Thus, among any four counters lying in succession, there is exactly one three point counter.
Since 101 = $4 \times 25$ + 1, then there are either 25 or 26 three-point counters. Examples: for 25 counters: 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, ..., 1, 3, 1, 2, 1; for 26 counters: 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, ..., 3, 1, 2, 1, 3.

25 or 26.
