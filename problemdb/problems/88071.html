<h1>Problem ID 88071</h1>
<p>
Find all of the natural numbers that, when divided by 7, have the same remainder and quotient. 
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
When dividing a number by 7, only 7 different remainders are possible.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The remainder when dividing by 7 cannot exceed 6, so the numbers that are of interest to us can be represented as 7a + a = 8a, where a = 1, 2, ..., 6. So, these numbers are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48.
