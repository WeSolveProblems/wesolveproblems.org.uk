<h1>Problem ID 88058</h1>
<p>
In a room, there are three-legged stools and four-legged chairs. When people sat down on all of these seats, there were 39 legs $($human and stool/chair legs$)$ in the room. How many stools are there in the room?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
According to the condition, there are five- and six-legged objects in the room, with 39 legs in total. The number of legs of the five-legged objects ends in 0 or 5. But this number cannot end in 0: then the number of legs of the six-legged objects will end in 9. In this case, there can be 1, 3, 5 or 7 five-legged objects. Using trial and error, we can determine that there were 3 five-legged objects and 4 six-legged objects. That is, in the room there are 4 chairs and 3 stools.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	3 stools.
