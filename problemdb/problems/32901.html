<h1>Problem ID 32901</h1>
<p>
Find a natural number greater than one that occurs in the Pascal triangle
<p>
a$)$ more than three times.
<p>
b$)$ more than four times.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
a$)$ This is any number of the form

where 1 $<$ k $<$ n / 2. It occurs twice in the n-th row and twice in the m-th line. The smallest of these numbers is

b$)$ The first method. Looking at the first lines of the Pascal triangle we can note that

This number is found twice in the 10th, 16th and 120th lines.
The second method. We will look for a number that is represented both in the form 
 <img src="32901 4.png">

and in the form
 <img src="32901 5.png">

. Then 12n $(n - 1)$ = $(m² - 1)$ $(m² - 2m)$. Assuming that 3n = m² - 2m and 4 $(n - 1)$ = m² - 1. Subtracting, we obtain n = 2m + 3. Substituting in the first equation, we get m² - 8m + 9 = 0, that is, m = 9, n = 21. Hence,

Thus, the number 210 is found twice in the 10th, 21st and 210th rows.
The third method. We will look for three numbers of the form m, 2m, 3m, standing consecutively in some row $($ then the number 3m = m + 2m will also be found in the next line $)$. If

 then

 but
 <img src="32901 9.png">

So, 2k + 2 = n - k, 3k + 6 = 2n - 2k - 2. Solving the equation system, we find k = 4, n = 14. So, the number
 <img src="32901 10.png">

 is found twice in the 14th, 15th $($ as
 <img src="32901 11.png">

$)$ and 3003rd lines.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
a$)$ For example, 10, 15, 21. b$)$ For example, 120, 210, 3003.
