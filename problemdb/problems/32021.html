<h1>Problem</h1>
If a class of 30 children is seated in the auditorium of a cinema, there will always be at least one row containing no fewer than two classmates. If we do the same with a class of 26 children, then at least three rows will be empty. How many rows are there in the auditorium?

<h1>Solution</h1>
The first condition tells us that there are no more than 29 rows. If the number of rows was no less than 30, it is obvious that it would be possible to seat a class of 30 children no more than one to a row.

The second condition means that the number of rows is no less than 29. If the number of rows is no greater than 28, when we seat the class of 26 children one by one in an empty row, either at some point all of the rows will be occupied (by one child) or all 26 children will be sitting one to a row - in which case there will be at most two remaining empty rows.

Therefore, the auditorium contains 29 rows. This is the only case where both conditions can be satisfied.
