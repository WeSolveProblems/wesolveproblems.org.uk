<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A spherical planet is surrounded by 25 point asteroids. Prove, that at any given moment there will be a point on the surface of the planet, from which an astronomer will not be able to see more than 11 asteroids.</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>An asteroid cannot simultaneusly be visible from two diametrically opposite points on the planet.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Draw a plane through the centre of the planet and two arbitrary asteroids. Then draw a straight line $l$ through the centre of the planet, that is perpendicular to the plane. The line $l$ intersects with the surface of the planet at two poles $A$ and $B$. It is clear that astronomers standing at points $A$ and $B$ will be unable to see any of the same asteroids, nor will either of them be able to see the two asteroids that the plane passes through. Therefore between them they can see no more than $25-2=23$ asteroids. This means that one of the astronomers can see no more than 11 asteroids (pigeon hole principle)</p>
