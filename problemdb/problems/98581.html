<h1>Problem ID 98581</h1>
<p>
Janine and Zahara each thought of a natural number and said them to Alex. Alex wrote the sum of the thought of numbers onto one sheet of paper, and on the other - their product, after which one of the sheets was hidden, and the other $($ on it was written the number of 2002 $)$ was shown to Janine and Zahara. Seeing this number, Janine said that she did not know what number Zahara had thought of. Hearing this, Zahara said that she did not know what number Janine had thought of. What was the number which Zahara had thought of?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Both of the thought of numbers were divisors of the number of 2002 $($ otherwise someone would understand that 2002 is the sum of the thought of numbers, and would be able to figure out the second number $)$. However, even knowing that Janine had thought of a divisor, Zahara can not rule out that 2002 is the sum. But the sum of divisors is equal to 2002 only in the case of 1001 + 1001 $($ other dividers are equal to 2002 or less than 1001 $)$. Hence, Masha thought of 1001 $($ and Janine - 2 or 1001, and therefore neither really could figure out each other's numbers).

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
1001.

Points: years 8-9. - 5, years 10-11. - 4.
