<h1>Problem ID 116433</h1>
<p>
The function f $($x$)$ is defined on the positive semiaxis and takes only positive values. It is known that f $($1$)$ + f $($2$)$ = 10 and
<IMG SRC="116433 1.png"> 
 for any a and b. Find f $($2^2011$)$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
It follows from the condition of the problem that f $($2a$)$ = f $($a + a$)$ = 4f $($a$)$. In particular, f $($2$)$ = 4f $($1$)$, therefore, 5f $($1$)$ = 10, that is, f $($1$)$ = 2.
The sequence f $($1$)$, f $($2$)$, f $($2^2$)$, ... is a geometric progression with a denominator of 4. The number f $($2^2011$)$ as the 2012th member of this progression is $2 \times 4^2011$ = $2^4023$.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
$2^4023$.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
The conditions of the problem are satisfied, for example, by the function f $($x$)$ = $x^2$.
