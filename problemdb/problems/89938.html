<h1>Problem ID 89938</h1>
<p>
An investigation is being conducted into the case of a stolen mustang. There are three suspects - Bill, Joe and Sam. At the trial, Sam said that the mustang was stolen by Joe. Bill and Joe also testified, but what they said, no one remembered, and all the records were lost. In the course of the trial it became clear that only one of the defendants had stolen the Mustang, and that only he had given a truthful testimony. So who stole the mustang?
 
</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Think about why Sam can not be a thief.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The thief can not be Sam, because the thief told the truth, and Sam, in this case, lied. The thief can not be Joe, because, in this case, Sam told the truth, but the truth was told only by the thief. So the thief is Bill.
