<h1>Problem ID 34905</h1>
<p>
  9 straight lines each divide a square into two quadrilaterals, with their areas having a ratio of 2:3. Prove that at least three of the nine lines pass through the same point.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  There are four fixed points inside the square such that every line dividing the square in the ratio 2:3 must pass through one of them.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Each of the nine straight lines divides the square into two trapeziums, the bases of which lie on the sides of the square and the heights of which are equal to the side length of the square. It is clear that the lines must divide one of the square's 'centre lines' in the ratio 2:3, as the ratio of the areas of the trapeziums is determined by the ratio of the square's centre line. Each of the two 'centre lines' has two points which divide them in the ratio 2:3. As a result, each of the 9 lines must pass through one of 4 defined points. Therefore, by the pigeon hole principle, one of the points must have at least 3 lines passing through it.
