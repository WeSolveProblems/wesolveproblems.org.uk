<h1>Problem ID 61324</h1>
<p>
We call the geometric-harmonic mean of numbers a and b the general limit of the sequences ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$ constructed according to the rule
<p>
$a_0 = a, b_0 = b, a_{n + 1}$ = <IMG SRC="61324 1.gif">, $b_{n + 1}$ = <IMG SRC="61324 2.gif"> $(n ≥ 0)$.
<p>
We denote it by $ν (a, b)$. Prove that $ν (a, b)$ is related to $μ (a, b)$ $($see problem number 61322$)$ by $ν (a, b) \times μ (1/a, 1/b) = 1$. 
<p>
Problem number 61322 says that both of these sequences have the same limit.
This limit is called the arithmetic-geometric mean of the numbers a, b and is denoted by $μ (a, b)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We can assume that a $<$b. Let's consider the sequences ${c_n} = {1/b_n}, {d_n} = {1/a_n}$. Then <IMG SRC="61324 3.gif"> According to problem 61322, the sequences ${c_n}$ and ${d_n}$ have a common limit $μ (1/a, 1/b)$. Consequently, the sequences ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$ have a common limit equal to <IMG SRC="61324 4.gif">

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
