<h1>Problem ID 103969</h1>
<p>
a$)$ Two players play in the following game: on the table there are 7 two pound coins and 7 one pound coins. In a turn it is allowed to take coins worth no more than three pounds. The one who takes the last coin wins. Who will win with the correct strategy?
<p>
b$)$ The same question, if there are 12 one pound and 12 two pound coins.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
In paragraph $(b)$, the second player must make the amount of money on the table each time a multiple of four pounds. In other words, if the first player takes one pound, then the second takes three pounds, if the first takes two, then the second two, if the first takes three, then the second one. It is not difficult to verify that each time it possible to take the required amount from the table. Thus, before each turn of the first player on the table there is at least four pounds, and so the first player can not win with that turn.
Note that this strategy allows the second player to win if at the beginning of the game on the table there is any amount that is a multiple of four pounds.
In part a$)$ the first player should for his first move take two pounds, after which the amount will be equal to 12 pounds. Next, he must act as the second player in the solution to part b$)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
a$)$ the first; b$)$ the second.
