<h1>Problem ID 98652</h1>
<p>
The population of China is one billion people. It would seem that on a map of China with a scale of 1: 1,000,000 $($1 cm: 10 km$)$, it would be possible to fit a million times fewer people than there is in the whole country. However, in fact, not only 1000, but even 100 people will not be able to be placed on this map. Can you explain this contradiction?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Pay attention, we are not talking about linear dimensions, but about the area.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since we are not talking about linear dimensions, but about the area, then the number of people should be reduced not by 1,000,000, but by $100,000^2$, i.ะต. a trillion times.
