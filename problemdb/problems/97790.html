<h1>Problem ID 97790</h1>
<p>
Prove that for every natural number n $>$ 1 the equality: [$n^{1 / 2}] + [n^{1/ 3}] + ... + [n^{1 / n}] = [log_{2}n] + [log_{3}n] + ... + [log_{n}n]$ is satisfied.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Add n to both parts. Let us prove that in the resulting equality both sides are equal to the number of pairs $(k, m)$ of natural numbers satisfying the inequality $k^m$ $≤$ n.
Indeed, the integer part of the number a $≥$ 1 is equal to the number of natural numbers less than or equal to a. therefore
<p>
[$n^{1 / m}$] is the number of pairs $(k, m)$ for which $k^m$ $≤$ n,
<p>
[$log_{k}$n] is the number of pairs $(k, m)$ for which $k^m$ $≤$ n.
