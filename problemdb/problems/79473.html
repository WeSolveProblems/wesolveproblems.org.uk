<h1>Problem ID 79473</h1>
<p>
The numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{1985}$ are the numbers 1, 2, ..., 1985 rearranged in some order. Each number $a_k$ is multiplied by its number k, and then the largest number is chosen among the resulting 1985 products. Prove that it is not less than $993^2$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The number of $a_k$s that are not less than 993 is exactly 993. Therefore, the ordering number of at least one of the $a_k$s is not less than 993, and for it $ka_k$ $\geg$ $993^2$$.
