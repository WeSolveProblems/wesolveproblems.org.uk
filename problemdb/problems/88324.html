<h1>Problem ID 88324</h1>
<p>
Teams A, B, C, D and E participated in a relay. Before the competition, five fans expressed the following forecasts.
<p>
  1) team E will take 1st place, team C - 2nd;
  <p>
  2) team A will take 2nd place, D - 4th;
  <p>
  3) C - 3rd place, E – 5th;
  <p>
  4) C - 1st place, D – 4th;
  <p>
  5) A - 2nd place, C - 3rd.
  <p>
In each forecast, one part was confirmed, and the other was not. What place did each team take?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  It follows from 1) that two cases are possible.
  <p>
  1. E took the 1st place. Then from 3) it follows that C took the third place, then from 5) it follows that A did not occupy the 2nd place, and then from 2) it follows that D was in 4th place. For A and B, the 2nd and 5th places remain, so A is 5th place.
  <p>
  2. C took 2nd place. Then in the forecast 5) there are no correct assumptions. This is a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>	
These are the teams in the order of occupied places: E, B, C, D, A.
