<h1>Problem ID 66046</h1>
<p>
 In one box, there are two pies with mushrooms, in another box there are two with cherries and in the third one, there is one with mushrooms and one with cherries. The pies look and weigh the same, so it's not known what is in each one. The grandson needs to take one pie to school. The grandmother wants to give him a pie with cherries, but she is confused herself and can only determine the filling by breaking the pie, but the grandson does not want a broken pie, he wants a whole one.
<p>
a)	Show that the grandmother can act so that the probability of giving the grandson a whole pie with cherries will be equal to 2/3.
<p>
  b) Is there a strategy in which the probability of giving the grandson a whole pie with cherries is higher than 2/3?

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
a)	Let the grandmother break a random pie. If it is with mushrooms, then she need to give her grandson any pie from any other box. If the broken pie is the cherry one, then she needs to give her grandson a second pie from the same box. We denote the boxes with MM, MC and CC in accordance with their contents. The broken pie can be with mushrooms from the MM box $($with probability 1/3$)$, or it can be a pie with mushrooms from the MC box $($with probability 1/6$)$. In the first case, any other pie will have cherries with probability of 3/4, and in the second case - with probability of ½.
<p>
  The broken pie can be with cherries from either the CC box $($with probability 1/3$)$, or from the MC box $($with probability 1/6$)$. In the first case, the second pie from the same box will be with cherries with probability 1, in the second - with probability 0. The total probability that the grandson will receive a pie with cherries is
$1/3 \times 3/4 + 1/6 \times 1/2 + 1/3 \times 1 + 1/6 \times 0 = 2/3$.
<p>
b)	Let the grandmother break one random pie from each box in turn. As soon as the cherry pie from any box is broken, it is necessary to give the grandson the second pie from the same box.
<p>
  The grandson will get a mushroom pie only in one of two cases: either the grandmother opened the MC box and broke the C pie $($with probability $1/3 \times ½$ = 1/6), or the grandmother opened the CC box, broke one of the pies, then took the MC box and broke the C pie $($with probability $1/3 \times 1/2 \times ½$ = 1/12). Hence, the grandson will get a pie with mushrooms with a probability of 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/4, and with cherries - with a probability of ¾ $>$ 2/3.

</p> 
<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
b) There is.

</p> 
<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
1.	The disadvantage of this method is the risk of breaking half of the pies. We do not know a strategy that gives a probability higher than 3/4.

2.	Marks: 1 + 2.
