<h1>Problem ID 64487</h1>
<p>
In a one-on-one tournament 10 chess players participate. What is the least number of rounds after which the single winner could have already been determined? $($In each round, the participants are broken up into pairs. Win - 1 point, draw - 0.5 points, defeat - 0$)$.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
After the sixth round, 30 points had been played for. The leader has no more than 6 points, and the remaining nine participants in total have scored at least 24 points. Consequently, among them there is at least one, who has more than three points. Since there are 3 more tours ahead, the winner is not yet determined.
</p>
Let the leader win all his games in the first 7 rounds, and the remaining games end in a draw. Then the two chess players who had not yet played with the leader, have 3.5 points each, and others each have 3. Since there are only 2 rounds left before the end of the tournament, the winner has already been determined.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
After 7 rounds.
