<h1>Problem ID 65902</h1>
<p>
There are 30 students in a class: excellent students, mediocre students and slackers. Excellent students answer all questions correctly, slackers are always wrong, and the mediocre students answer questions alternating one by one correctly and incorrectly. All the students were asked three questions: "Are you an excellent pupil?", "Are you a mediocre student?", "Are you a slacker?". 19 students answered "Yes" to the first question, to the second 12 students answered yes, to the third 9 students answered yes. How many mediocre students study in this class?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let a be the number of excellent students, b - the number of slackers, c - the number of mediocre students, who made a mistake in answering the first question, answered the second correctly and were mistaken in the answer to the third question.
By the condition a + b + c = 19, b + c = 12, c = 9. Hence b = 3, a = 7. Hence, the number of players is 30 - 7 - 3 = 20.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
20 mediocre students.
