<h1>Problem ID 88086</h1>
<p>
Can the following equality be true:
<p>
$K \times O \times T$ = $A \times B \times C \times D \times E \times F$
<p>
if you substitute the letters with the numbers from 1 to 9? Different letters correspond to different numbers.

<h1>Hint</h1>
Can both sides of the equation be multiples of 7?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Yes, he will be able to. 
<p>
The equality cannot be true because one of the letters must necessarily correspond to the number 7; then that part of the equality into which this letter enters will be divisible by 7, and the second part of the equality will not be divisible by 7. Hence, they cannot be equal. This reasoning is also valid for the number 5.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
This is impossible: one part of the equation will be a multiple of 7, the other not.
