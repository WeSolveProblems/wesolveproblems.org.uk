<h1>Problem ID 30430</h1>
<p>
In a country coming out of each city there are 100 roads and from each city it is possible to reach any other. One road was closed for repairs.
Prove that even now you can get from every city to any other.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
If AB is closed, then it is sufficient for us to prove that after that we can still get from A to B. If this is not the case, then in the connected component containing A, all the vertices except that of A are even. But the presence of exactly one odd vertex contradicts the problem number 87972 b$)$.
