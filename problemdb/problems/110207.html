<h1>Problem ID 110207</h1>
<p>
Natural numbers from 1 to 200 are divided into 50 sets. Prove that in one of the sets there are three numbers that are the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Letâ€™s consider the numbers from 100 to 200. Since there are only 101 of them, then some three of them will fall into one set. The sum of any two of these three numbers is greater than 200, and, therefore, is greater than the third number. Hence, there is a triangle with the corresponding lengths of the sides.
</p>
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
At the Mathematical Regatta, the last phrase of the condition was different:
"Is it always the case that at least in one of the sets there are three numbers that are the lengths of the sides of a triangle?"
