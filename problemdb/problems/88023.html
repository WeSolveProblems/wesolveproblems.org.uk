<h1>Problem ID 88023</h1>
<p>
48 blacksmiths must shoe 60 horses. Each blacksmith spends 5 minutes on one horseshoe. What is the shortest time they should spend on the work? $($ Note that a horse can not stand on two legs. $)$
 
</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Pay attention, in less than 25 minutes you can not shoe all the horses. Why?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We show how to act. First 48 blacksmiths take 48 horses and each shoe one leg, it takes 5 minutes, 48 horses have one horseshoe each, 12 have no horseshoes. Then 12 blacksmiths shoe those horses that do not yet have horseshoes, and the remaining 36 blacksmiths put second horseshoes on 36 horses.
This again takes 5 minutes, 36 horses now have two horseshoes and 24 have one. Now 24 blacksmiths put second horseshoes on horses, and 24 - the third. Now 24 horses have three horseshoes and 36 have two. Now 36 blacksmiths put 36 third horseshoes on and 12 put a fourth on 12 horses. Now there are 48 horses with three horseshoes and 12 with four. The last stage - 48 blacksmiths put the last horseshoes onto 48 horses. So, in 5 stages, i.ะต. for 25 minutes, all horses are shoed. We show that in less than 25 minutes this can not be done. It is necessary to put $60 \times 4$ = 240 horseshoes. Each horseshoe needs 5 minutes, which means that it can be done in no less than $240 \times 5$ = 1200 minutes. But we have 48 blacksmiths, so you can do this in 1200/ 48 = 25 minutes, but no less. We did it in 25 minutes.
