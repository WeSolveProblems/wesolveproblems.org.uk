<h1>Problem ID 65325</h1>
<p>
Hercules meets the three-headed snake Hydra of Lerna. Every minute, Hercules chops off one head of the snake. Let x be the survivability of the snake $(x > 0)$. The probability $p_s$ of the fact that in the place of the severed head will grow s new heads $($s = 0, 1, 2$)$ is equal to <img src="65325 1.gif">
 During the first 10 minutes of the battle, Hercules recorded how many heads grew in place of each chopped off one. The following vector was obtained: K = $($1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2$)$. Find the value of the survivability of the snake, under which the probability of the vector K is greatest.

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
  Due to the mutual independence of the growth of the heads $($the number of new-grown heads depends only on survivability, but not on previous events$)$, the probability of the vector K is equal to

<p>
 It is necessary to find the point at which this function takes the greatest value on the ray
$($0; + ∞$)$.

<p>
  Equating the derivative to zero, we obtain the unique positive root $x_0$ = <img src="65325 0.png">
. Since $P (x) \geq 0, P (0) = 0$, and P $($x$)$ → 0
as $x → ∞$, then $x_0$ is the unique maximum point.
