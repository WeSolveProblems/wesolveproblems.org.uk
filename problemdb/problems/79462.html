<h1>Problem ID 79462</h1>
<p>
The judges of an Olympiad decided to denote each participant with a natural number in such a way that it would be possible to unambiguously reconstruct the number of points received by each participant in each task, and that from each two participants the one with the greater number would be the participant which received a higher score. Help the judges solve this problem!

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let the Olympiad consist of 6 tasks. Then we will evaluate each task according to the 6-point system $($ the number of points varies from 0 to 5 $)$. Each participant is assigned an 8-digit number, the first two digits of which express the sum of the points scored by the student, and each of the remaining six digits are equal to the number of points for the corresponding task.
If there are more tasks, the design is similar.
