<h1>Problem ID 104060</h1>
<p>
 Gabby is standing on a river bank. She has two clay jars: one - for 5 litres, and about the second Gabby remembers only that it holds either 3 or 4 litres. Help Gabby determine the capacity of the second jar. $($Looking into the jar, you cannot figure out how much water is in it.$)$

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The first method. Let Gabby pour water from the full small jug into the large one, and then fill the small one and the she will pour water from that small jug into the large one until it is completely filled. Next, Gabby needs to empty the large jar and pour the remainder of what is in the small jar into it. If the small jar was 3 litres, then now in the large jar there will be 1 litre, otherwise there will be 3 litres. Now let Gabby again try to pour water from the full small jar into the big one. If it succeeds, then the small one was three-litre, if the water spills over the edge - four-litre.
The second method. If Gabby had a large jar holding 10 litres, then it would be enough to try to pour water into it from the small one three times. If the water spills over the edge, then the small one is 4 litres, if not, then it is only 3. With a five-litre jar, such a test is possible if Gabby empties the five-litre jar when it is filled.
