<h1>Problem ID 65268</h1>
<p>
There are 25 children in a class. At random, two are chosen. The probability that both children will be boys is 3/25. How many girls are in the class?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Suppose that in the class there are n boys, then the number of ways to choose from them a pair is equal to n $($n - 1$)$, the number of ways to choose a pair from the whole class is $25 \times 24$. Therefore, the probability that two boys will be chosen is n $($n-1$)$/ $($25 \times 24$)$ = 3/25. Hence n $($n - 1$)$ = 72 = $9 \times 8$. Consequently, n = 9, that is, in the class there are 9 boys and 16 girls.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
16 girls.
