<h1>Problem ID 98629</h1>
<p>
In a basket, there are 30 mushrooms. Among any 12 of them there is at least one brown one, and among any 20 mushrooms, there is at least one chanterelle. How many brown mushrooms and how many chanterelles are there in the basket?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note: among any 12 mushrooms there is at least one brown one.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since there is at least one brown mushroom among any 12 mushrooms, there cannot be more than 11 chanterelles. And since among any 20 mushrooms, there is at least one chanterelle, then there cannot be more than 19 brown mushrooms. But since there are only 30 mushrooms in the basket, the only possible option is that the basket contains 19 brown mushrooms and 11 chanterelles?
