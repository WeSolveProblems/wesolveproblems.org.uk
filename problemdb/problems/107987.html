<h1>Problem ID 107987</h1>
<p>
To each pair of numbers x and y some number x * y is placed in correspondence. Find 1993 * 1935 if it is known that for any three numbers x, y, z, the following identities hold: x * x = 0 and x * $(y * z)$ = $(x * y)$ + z.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
x = x * x + x = x * $(x * x)$ = x * 0 = x * $(y * y)$ = x * y + y.
So, x * y = x - y. Therefore 1993 * 1935 = 1993 - 1935 = 58.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
58.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
1. If we take x * y = x - y, then both identities are really satisfied.
<p>
2. Compare with problem no. 98169.
