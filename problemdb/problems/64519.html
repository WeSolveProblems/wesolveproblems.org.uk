<h1>Problem ID 64519</h1>
<p>
Author: D.V. Baranov
<p>
Vlad and Peter are playing the following game. On the board two numbers written are: 1/2009 and 1/2008. At each turn, Vlad calls any number x, and Peter increases one of the numbers on the board (whichever he wants) by x. Vlad wins if at some point one of the numbers on the board becomes equal to 1. Will Vlad win, no matter how Peter acts?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
It is enough for Vlad to call the number a = 1/2008 Â· 2009 at each step. Then both numbers on the board will be "multiples" of a. Since the sum of the numbers grows, then, by discrete continuity, one of them will at some point become equal to 1.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, he will be able to.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
3 points
