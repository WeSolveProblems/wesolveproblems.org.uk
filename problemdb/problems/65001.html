<h1>Problem ID 65001</h1>
<p>
In a row there are 20 different natural numbers. The product of every two of them standing next to one another is the square of a natural number. The first number is 42. Prove that at least one of the numbers is greater than 16,000.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
We note that 42 = $2 \times 3 \times 7$, that is, all prime factors enter into its expansion in the first degree. Therefore, in order for the product of the first two numbers to be a complete square, the second number must have the form

where $k_1$ is a natural number.
Since the product of the second and third numbers is a complete square, the third number, for the same reasons, has the form

where $k_2$ is a natural number, and so on. Thus, all the written numbers, except the first, have the form
<IMG SRC="65001 3.png"> 
 where $k_i$ is a natural number which does not equal one. Since all the numbers are different, the largest of the numbers $k_i$ cannot be less than 20. Therefore, one of the recorded numbers is no less than $42 \times 20^2$ $>$ 16,000.
