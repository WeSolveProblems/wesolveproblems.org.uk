<h1>Problem ID 31087</h1> <p>
The faces of a polyhedron are coloured in two colours so that the neighbouring faces are of different colours. It is known that all of the faces except for one have a number of edges that is a multiple of 3. Prove that this one face has a multiple of 3 edges.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The total number of edges of a polyhedron is equal to the total number of edges of white faces and the total number of edges of black faces. One of these sums (and hence the second) is a multiple of 3. In the second, all of the terms except for one are multiples of 3. This means that this term is also a multiple of 3.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
