<h1>Problem ID 65344</h1>
<p>
In the cabinet of Anchuria there are 100 ministers. Among them there are honest and dishonest ministers. It is known that out of any ten ministers, at least one minister is dishonest. What is the smallest number of dishonest ministers there could be in the cabinet?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
There are no more than nine honest ministers as if there were ten honest ministers then this would contradict the condition. On the other hand, the presence of exactly nine honest ministers does not contradict the condition.

91.
