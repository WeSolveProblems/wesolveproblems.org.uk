<h1>Problem ID 32832</h1>
<p>
There is a place where there live people who are not part of any group (always tell the truth) and people who are part of group A (always lie). Half of the inhabitants are in group B and so believe that true statements are false and false statements are true. How can you find out, with one question that can be answered "yes" or "no", whether:
</p>
	<p>
	a) the person you are speaking to is in group B or not?
	</p>
	<p>
	b) the person you are speaking to is in group A or not?
	</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a) "Are you in group A?".
b) "Are you in group B?".
