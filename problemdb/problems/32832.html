<h1>Problem ID 32832</h1>
<p>
There is a place where there live people who are not part of any group &#40;always tell the truth&#41; and people who are part of group A &#40;always lie&#41;. Half of the inhabitants are in group B and so believe that true statements are false and false statements are true. How can you find out, with one question that can be answered "yes" or "no", whether:
</p>
	<p>
	a&#41; the person you are speaking to is in group B or not?
	</p>
	<p>
	b&#41; the person you are speaking to is in group A or not?
	</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a&#41; "Are you in group A?".
b&#41; "Are you in group B?".

</p>
