<h1>Problem ID 58094</h1>
<p>
  Several chords are drawn through a unit circle. Prove that if each diameter intersects with no more than $k$ chords, then the total length of all the chords is less than $\pi k$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  We will assume that the total length of the chords is not less than $ \pi k$ and then prove that there will be a diameter intersecting with at least $k+1$ chords. Since the length of the arc around a given chord is always longer than the length of the given chord itself, the total arc length around all the chords must be greater than $ \pi k$. If we add to these chords the chords symmetrical about the centre of the circle, we get a total arc length of at least $2 \pi k$. Therefore there must be a point which lies on at least $k+1$ of these arcs. The diameter passing through this point will cross at least $k+1$ arcs.
