<h1>Problem ID 61302</h1>
<p>
Old calculator I. 
<p>a$)$ Suppose that we want to find $\sqrt[3]{x}$ $(x> 0)$ on a calculator that can find $\sqrt{x}$ in addition to four ordinary arithmetic operations. Consider the following algorithm. A sequence of numbers {$y_n$} is constructed, in which $y_0$ is an arbitrary positive number, for example, $y_0$ = $\sqrt{\sqrt{x}}$, and the remaining elements are defined by
$y_{n + 1}$ = $\sqrt{\sqrt{x y_n}}$ $($n $\geq$ 0$)$.
 <p>
Prove that
$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ $y_n$ = $\sqrt[3]{x}$.
<p> 
b$)$ Construct a similar algorithm to calculate the fifth root.
</p>

Nothing to translate.
