<h1>Problem ID 31076</h1>
<p>
Can the degrees of vertices in the graph be equal to:
<p>
a)	8, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2?
<p>
b)	7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 2, 1?
<p>
   c) 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2?
</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a)	In a graph of eight vertices, the degree of 8 cannot occur.
<p>
b)	If there are two vertices that are connected with all other vertices, then the degree of each of the remaining vertices is at least 2.
<p>
   c) The sum of the degrees of vertices must be even.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a)-c) No, they cannot.
