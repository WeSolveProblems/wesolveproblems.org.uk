<h1>Problem ID 58084</h1>
<p>
There are 25 points on a plane, and among any three of them there can be found two points with a distance between them of less than 1. Prove that there is a circle of radius 1 containing at least 13 of these points.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Let A be one of these points. If all the other points lie in a circle $S_1$ of radius 1 with centre A, then there is nothing more to prove. Now let B be a given point outside the circle $S_1$, that is, AB $>$ 1. Consider a circle $S_2$ of radius 1 with centre B. Among the points A, B and C, where C is any of these given points, there are two with a distance between them of less than 1, and this cannot be among points A and B. Therefore, the circles $S_1$ and $S_2$ contain all the given points, that is, one of them contains at least 13 points.
