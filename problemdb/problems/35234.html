<h1>Problem ID 35234</h1>
<p>
A pentagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 1. Prove that the sum of the lengths of its sides and diagonals is less than 17.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
We can estimate the sum of the sides and the sum of the diagonals of the pentagon separately.
 </p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since the length of each diagonal of the pentagon is not greater than the diameter of the circle, then the sum of the lengths of the diagonals is not greater than $5 \times 2$ = 10. The sum of the lengths of the sides of the pentagon is less than the circumference, since the length of each side is less than the length of the arc that it encompasses. Thus, the sum of the sides is less than 2n, which in turn is less than $2 \times 3.2< 7$. Therefore, the total sum is less than 10 + 7 = 17.
