<h1>Problem ID 35524</h1>
<p>
Of 11 balls, 2 are radioactive. For any set of balls in one check, you can find out if there is at least one radioactive ball in it $($but you cannot tell how many of them are radioactive$)$. Is it possible to find both radioactive balls in 7 checks?

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Divide the balls into several groups.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Yes, it is possible. We divide the balls into 5 groups of 2 balls and one more ball. Let's check these 5 groups. If two of them are radioactive, then from each pile one radioactive ball is found in one check. If only one group is radioactive, we check both balls in it.
