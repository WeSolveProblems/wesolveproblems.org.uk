<h1>Problem ID 115512</h1>
<p>
Prove that if the numbers x, y, z for some values of p and q are solutions of the system of equations:
y = $x^n$ + px + q, z = $y^n$ + py + q, x = $z^n$ + pz + q,
then the inequality $x^2$y + $y^2$z + $z^2$x $≥$ $x^2$z + $y^2$x + $z^2$y is satisfied.
Consider the cases where a$)$ n = 2; b$)$ n = 2010.
</p> 
 
<h1>Solution</h1> <p>
a$)$ We multiply the first, second and third equations of the system by y, z and x, respectively, and by adding them, we obtain
$x^2$ + $y^2$ + $z^2$ = $x^2$y + $y^2$z + $z^2$x + p $($xy + xz + yz$)$ + q $($x + y + z$)$.
On the other hand, multiplying the first equation of the original system by z, the second by x, and the third by y and folding, we get
xy + xz + yz = $x^2$z + $y^2$x + $z^2$y + p $($xy + xz + yz$)$ + q $($x + y + z$)$.
Hence, $x^2$ + $y^2$ + $z^2$ - xy - xz - yz = $x^2$y + $y^2$z + $z^2$x - $x^2$z - $y^2$x - $z^2$y.
The left-hand side is nonnegative, and hence the right-hand side is also nonnegative.
<p>
b$)$ $x^2$y + $y^2$z + $z^2$x - $x^2$z - $y^2$x - $z^2$y = $x^2$ $(y - z)$ + x $(z^2 - y^2)$ + yz $(y - z)$ = $(y - z)$ $(x^2 - xz - xy + yz)$ = $(x - y)$ $(x - z)$ $(y - z)$, so the proven inequality is equivalent to the inequality $(x - y)$ $(x - z)$ $(y - z)$ $≤$ 0.
If among the numbers x, y and z there are at least two which are equal, then the inequality turns into the inequality on the right. Suppose that all these numbers are pairwise distinct. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the smallest of them is x. We shall prove then that z $<$ y.
Consider the function f $(t)$ = $t^{2010}$ + pt + q. Its derivative f '$(t)$ = $2010t^{2009}$ + p. Consequently, the function f $(t)$ decreases for t $<$ $t_0$ and increases when t $>$ $t_0$. If y $≤$ $t_0$, then x $<$ y $≤$ $t_0$ and y = f $(x)$ $>$ z = f $(y)$. If z $>$ y $>$ $t_0$, then x = f $(z)$ $>$ z = f $(y)$. Therefore we get a contradiction
</p>
 
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
The statement $($with the same proof$)$ remains true when the function f is replaced by any other convex function, and all strict inequalities are replaced with non-strict ones: for each such function f, the inequality $x^2$y + $y^2$z + $z^2$x $≥$ $x^2$z + $y^2$x + $z^2$y is true for any triple of numbers x, y, z connected by the equalities y = f $(x)$, z = f $(y)$, x = f $(z)$. In particular, we can obtain another proof of part a$)$ with this method.
