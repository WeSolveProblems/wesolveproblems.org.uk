<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  Over the course of 92 days an airline flew exactly 10 flights each day. Each day each plane flew no more than one flight. It is known that for any two days in this period, there will be exactly one plane which flew on both those days. Prove that there is a plane that flew every day in this period.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider the 10 planes that flew on the first day. At least one of these planes must have flown on at least 10 other days (since on each of the remaining 91 days one of these 10 planes must have flown).
</p>
<p>
  Consider a plane which flew on no fewer than 11 days. Without loss of generality, say that these 11 days were the first 11 days (and perhaps some others). Consider that there is a day $A$ on which this plane did not fly. Then on each of the first 11 days and day $A$ there must be a plane which flew on that day and on day $A$. For two of those first 11 days, the plane must be the same one, as only 10 flights took place on day $A$. This is a contradiction. Therefore no such day $A$ can exist, and a plane must have flown every day.
