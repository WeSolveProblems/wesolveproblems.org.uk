<h1>Problem ID 88129</h1>
<p>
Jack and Ben had a bicycle on which they went to a neighbouring village. They rode it in turns, but whenever one rode, the other walked and did not run. They managed to arrive in the village at the same time and almost twice as fast than if they had both walked. How did they do it?
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to organise the trip so that both Jack and Ben travelled exactly half of the route by bicycle.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Jack rode on a bicycle half way, got off it and then went on foot. And Ben walked the first half of the way on foot, then went to the bike, sat on it and rode off. So, they saved time.
