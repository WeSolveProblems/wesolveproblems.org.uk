<h1>Problem ID 64613</h1>
<p>
A polynomial of degree n $>$ 1 has n distinct roots $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$. Its derivative has the roots $y_1$, $y_2$, ..., $y_{n-1}$.
Prove the inequality

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We can assume that our polynomial can be reduced to: P $(x)$ = $x^n$ - $a_1x^{n-1}$ + $a_2x^{n-2}$ + ... By Viet formulas, $x_1$ + ... + $x_n$ = $a_1$, $x_1x_2$ + $x_1x_3$ + ... + $x_{n-1}x_n$ = $a_2$, whence

Since P ' $(x)$ = $nx^{n-1}$ - $(n-1)$ $a_1x^{n-2}$ + $(n-2)$ $a_2x^{n-3}$ + ..., we similarly obtain:

After substituting the resulting expression in the right-hand side of the original inequality, multiplying by n-1, and reducing such terms, it turns into a known inequality between the mean square and the arithmetic mean $($ for unequal numbers, see problem 61402b $)$.
 
</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. 6 points.
2. The task was also proposed in the Taskbook "Quantum" $($ "Quantum", 2008, No. 6, back M2113$)$.
