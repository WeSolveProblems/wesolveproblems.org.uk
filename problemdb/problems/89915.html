<h1>Problem ID 89915</h1>
<p>
A bagel is cut into sectors. Ten cuts were made. How many pieces did this make?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Remember task 89914.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
When a bagel is cut into pieces, the number of cuts and the number of sectors coincide, since one cut is needed in order to "make" a sector from the bagel.
