<h1>Problem ID 88162</h1>
<p>
Once Alice was in one of two countries - A or Z. She knows that all of the residents of country A always tell the truth, and all the inhabitants of country Z always lie. Moreover, they often go to visit each other. Can Alice, after asking a single question to the first person that she meets, find out which country she is in?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to find questions to which all of the people who are currently in country A will respond in the same way, and then among those questions choose those for which Z will respond in the same way, but in a different way to those living in country A.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
First, we will determine the questions that all who are currently in country A will answer to in the same way, and then among these questions we will select those for which all of Z will respond in the same way but in a different way than all of those living in country A. So, being in a country of honest people, Alice should ask such a question, to which both the honest local resident and the visiting liar would give the same answer, for example "yes." The point is that the answer "yes" to this question was for the locals the truth, and for the visiting liars, lies. In other words, this issue should relate to such circumstances of the person being questioned, which are true only for local residents. There are two such circumstances: the existence of honesty and the number of local residents. Therefore, there are two questions: either "Are you honest?" Or "Are you a local?". To any of these issues, people in country A always answer "yes." But, to the first question: "Are you honest?", those in the country Z, as well as everywhere in the world, will also answer "yes". Therefore, the first question is not suitable for Alice, but the second one ("Are you a local?") is good: in country A, yes will always be the answer, but in the country Z, it will be no.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
 Yes. "Are you a resident of this country?"
