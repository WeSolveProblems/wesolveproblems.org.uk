<h1>Problem ID 35764</h1>
<p>
A message is encrypted by replacing the letters of the source text with pairs of digits according to some table $($known only to the sender and receiver$)$ in which different letters of the alphabet correspond to different pairs of digits. The cryptographer was given the task to restore the encrypted text. In which case will it be easier for him to perform the task: if it is known that the first word of the second line is a "thermometer" or that the first word of the third line is "smother"? Justify your answer. $($It is assumed that the cryptographic table is not known$)$.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The problem is facilitated by decoding not the length of a known word, but a set of known letters.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In the second case, pairs of digits are known which encrypt letters from the set {"s", "m", "o", "t", "h", "e", “r”}, and in the first - pairs of digits for letters of the same set, with the exception of the letter "s".
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
In the second case, it is easier.
