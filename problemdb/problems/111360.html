<h1>Problem ID 111360</h1>
<p>
A magician with a blindfold gives a spectator five cards with the numbers from 1 to 5 written on them. The spectator hides two cards, and gives the other three to the assistant magician. The assistant indicates to the spectator two of them, and the spectator then calls out the numbers of these cards to the magician $($ in the order in which he wants $)$. After that, the magician guesses the numbers of the cards hidden by the spectator. How can the magician and the assistant make sure that the trick always works?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We number the vertices of a regular pentagon with the numbers from 1 to 5. We name the sides and diagonals using the numbers of these vertices. A pair of cards hidden by the viewer corresponds to one of the segments. Among the three cards, the assistant has a pair corresponding to the parallel segment. He names that segment to the magician.
