<h1>Problem ID 88045</h1>
<p>
Fill the free cells of the "hexagon" $($see the figure$)$ with integers from 1 to 19 so that in all vertical and diagonal rows the sum of the numbers, in the same row, is the same.

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
	Try to determine the sum of numbers in one row, then you can arrange several numbers in the hexagon. Then try to determine which number is in the central cell.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since one of the rows of the hexagon is filled, we can determine the sum of the series - it is equal to 38. Now it is possible to arrange numbers in many cells $($see the figure$)$.

There are 7 empty cells in which the numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15 should be located. Consider the diagonal on which the numbers 10, 1, 18 are located. Two empty cells on it must be occupied by two numbers with a sum of 9. This can only be 4 and 5. Now consider the diagonal on which the numbers 16, 2, 9 are located. Two empty cells on it must be occupied by two numbers with a sum of 11. This can only be 5 and 6. Hence, the number in the centre is 5, and the second numbers on the diagonals are 4 and 6, respectively. Now you can fill the entire table.
