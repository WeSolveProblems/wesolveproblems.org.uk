<h1>Problem ID 98155</h1>
<p>
The function f $(x)$ on the interval [a, b] is equal to the maximum of several functions of the form $y = C \times 10^{- | x-d |}$ $($where d and C are different, and all C are positive$)$. It is given that f $(a)$ = f $(b)$. Prove that the sum of the lengths of the sections on which the function increases is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sections on which the function decreases.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>  
The areas where the function f$(x)$ increases and where it decreases coincide with the segments where the function

 increases and where it decreases, where the functions gi $(x)$ have the form $b_i$ - | x - $d_i$ |.
Consider some section [u, v] of the part of the function g where it increases which coincides with one of the functions $g_i$. It is clear that the length of this section is equal to g $(v)$ - g $(u)$, that is, the value of g increases on this section. The situation with the areas of decrease is analogous. Thus, the difference in the sums indicated in the condition is equal to the change in the value of the function g on the interval [a, b], and it is equal to zero by the hypothesis.
