<h1>Problem ID 35012</h1>
<p>
It is known that 35! = 10333147966386144929 * 66651337523200000000. Find the number replaced by an asterisk.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The number 35! is divisible by 9.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Because 35! is divisible by 9, the sum of the digits of this number is also divisible by 9. It is easy to calculate that the sum of the digits $($with the exception of the asterisk$)$ of the written number gives the remainder 3 when divided by 9. It follows that the number replaced by an asterisk is 6.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
6.
