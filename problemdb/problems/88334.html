<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
    When multiplying the divisor by 8, we get a two-digit number. This means that the divisor does not exceed 12, because 13 × 8 = 104 is a three-digit number. If the divisor is multiplied by the first or last digit of the quotient $($which is greater than 8$)$, we get a three-digit number, hence the divisor is 12. So, 12 × 989 = 11868.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>	
11868/12 = 989.
