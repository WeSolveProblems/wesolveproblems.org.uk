<h1>Problem ID 65305</h1>
<p>
The upper side of a piece of square paper is white, and the lower one is red. In the square, a point F is randomly chosen. Then the square is bent so that one randomly selected vertex overlaps the point F. Find the mathematical expectation of the number of sides of the red polygon that appears.

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
The result depends only on the mutual position of the point F and the selected vertex. Therefore, we can assume that the vertex is fixed $($let it be the vertex A$)$, and the point F is chosen randomly.

If the point F belongs to the orange polygon, then as a result of addition, we get a triangle $($the middle perpendicular to the segment AF will intersect one of the sides AD or BC$)$, and if the point F is outside the orange shape, in the gray area, then there will be a quadrilateral. If we assume that the area of the square is 1, then the probabilities $P_g$ and $P_o$ of the point F, respectively, falling in the gray and orange regions are equal to the areas of these regions: $P_g$ = 2 $($1 - π / 4$)$ = 2 - π / 2, $P_o$ = 1 – $P_g$ = π / 2 - 1. So, the mathematical expectation is 3$P_o$ + 4$P_g$ = 3 $($π / 2 - 1$)$ + 4 $($2 - π / 2$)$ = 5 - π / 2 ≈ 3,429.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
5 - π / 2 ≈ 3.429.
