<h1>Problem ID 78492</h1> <p>
	A system of points connected by segments is called "connected" if from each point one can go to any other one along these segments. Is it possible to connect five points to a connected system so that when erasing any segment, exactly two connected points systems are formed that are not related to each other? $($We assume that in the intersection of the segments, the transition from one of them to another is impossible$)$.


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
This is possible, for example, if all points are connected in a chain.


</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, it is.
