<h1>Problem ID 34866</h1>
<p>7 natural numbers are written around the edges of a circle. It is known that in each pair of adjacent numbers one is divisible by the other. Prove that there will be another pair of numbers that are not adjacent that share this property.</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>Draw some arrows from the dividend to the divisor.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>We can draw arrows from the dividend, the number being divided, to the dividend, the number being divided by. If the numbers are the same choose at random. Since the number of arrows is odd, they cannot alternate. It follows that somewhere on the circle there will be two arrows pointing in the same direction. For example $x \rightarrow y \rightarrow z$. This means that $x$ is divisible by $y$ and $y$ is divisible by $z$. Therefore $x$ is divisible by $z$ so follows the rule given, but $x$ and $z$ are not adjacent.</p>
