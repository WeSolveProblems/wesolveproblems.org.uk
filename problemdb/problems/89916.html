<h1>Problem ID 89916</h1>
<p>
How can we explain why the answers in problems 89914 and 89915 are different?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Pay attention, that from a bagel "to make" a sector, one cut is required.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
When a bagel is cut into pieces, the number of cuts and the number of sectors coincide, since one cut is needed in order to "make" a sector from the bagel.
