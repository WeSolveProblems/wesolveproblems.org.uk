<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  Three players are playing knockout table tennis - that is, the player who loses a game swaps places with the player who did not take part in that game (i.e. winner stays on). In total Andrew played 10 games, Ben played 15 and Charlotte played 17. Which player lost the second game played?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  In total there were $(10+5+17) \div 2=21$ games played. Notice that no player can lose two games in a row. Therefore, Andrew must have played all of the even numbered games, and only these. Since he did not play in the third game, he must have lost the second.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  Andrew.
