<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  You are given 7 straight lines on a plane, no two of which are parallel. Prove that there will be two lines, such that the angle between them is less than $26^{\circ}$ .
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let us define an arbitrary point $A$ which lies in the plane. Draw 7 straight lines through $A$ which are parallel to the lines given. The angles between these lines will be equal to the corresponding angles between the straight lines of the original system. But the 7 lines passing through A have angles between them that sum to $360^{\circ}$, dividing the circle into 14 parts. Therefore there will be at least one angle which is no greater than $360^{\circ} \div 14 = (25 \frac{5}{7})^{\circ} < 26^{\circ}$
