<h1>Problem ID 56541</h1>
<p>
The vertex A of the acute-angled triangle ABC is connected by a segment with the center O of the circumscribed circle. The height AH is drawn from the vertex A. Prove that $\angle$BAH = $\angle$OAC.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We draw the diameter AD. Then $\angle$CDA = $\angle$CBA, and hence $\angle$BAH = $\angle$DAC, since $\angle$BHA = $\angle$ACD = 90$^{\circ}$.
