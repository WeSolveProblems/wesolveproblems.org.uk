<h1>Problem ID 88068</h1>
<p>
Jack the goldminer extracted 9kg of golden sand. Will he be able to measure 2kg of sand in three goes with the help of scales: a) with two weights of 200g and 50g; b) with one weight of 200g?

<h1>Hint</h1>
Try to start by dividing the sand into two equal parts.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Yes, he will be able to. 
<p>
The first case $($weights of 200 g and 50 g$)$: 1st weighing: 4.5 kg = 4.5 kg. 2nd: 2.25 kg = 2.25 kg. 3rd: 2.25 kg = 2 kg + 200 g + 50 g. 
<p>
The second case $($weight of 200g$)$: 1st weighing: 4.6 kg = 4.4 kg + 200 g. 2nd: 4.4 kg = 2.2 kg + 2.2 kg. 3rd: 2.2 kg = 2 kg + 200 g.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
He can in both cases.
