<h1>Problem ID 35148</h1>
<p>
Construct a function defined at all points on a real line which is continuous at exactly one point.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1> 
<p>
One can separately define a function on sets of rational and irrational points.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
We define the function f $($x$)$ by the equalities f $($x$)$ = 0 for rational x and f $($x$)$ = x for an irrational x. For any positive d if | x | $<$ d | f $($x$)$ -f $($0$)$ | = | f $($x$)$ | $<$ d, then the function f $($x$)$ is continuous at the point x = 0. On the other hand, let a be non-zero. In any plane with the point x = a there are two points x = b and x = c such that b is rational and c is irrational, and the irrational number c can be chosen so that | ca | $<$ | a | / 2. Then in any plane a for these b and c from the plane under consideration, we have | f $($b$)$ -f $($c$)$ | $>$ | 0-a / 2 | = | a / 2 |, which contradicts the continuity of f $($x$)$ at point a.
