<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  Prove that amongst any 11 different decimal fractions of infinite length, there will be two whose digits in the same column (10ths, 100s, 1000s etc) coincide (are the same) an infinite number of times.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  For each column, there will always be at least two of the fractions, whose digits coincide in that column.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Write out the 11 fractions one above the other, so that each column is in the same position for each decimal. Each column now contains 11 digits, therefore each must contain at least one digit at least twice. Let the two decimal fractions containing the same digit in this column be numbered as the $k$th and the $m$th fractions. In this way, each column in the decimals has a pair of numbers from 1 to 11 (equal to the values of $k$ and $m$ for that column) corresponding to it. Since the number of possible pairs of these 11 numbers is finite, but the number of columns (decimal places of all the decimals) is infinite, at least one of the pairs $(k_0, m_0)$ occurs in an infinite number of columns. This means that the decimal fractions with the numbers $k_0$ and $m_0$ coincide in an infinite number of columns, as required.
