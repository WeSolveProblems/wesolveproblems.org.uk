<h1>Problem ID 32861</h1>
<p>
A country is called a Fiver if, in it, each city is connected by airlines with exactly with five other cities $($there are no international flights$)$.
<p>
a)	Draw a scheme of airlines for a country that is made up of 10 cities.
<p>
b)	How many airlines are there in a country of 50 cities?
<p>
c)	Can there be a Fiver country, in which there are exactly 46 airlines?
<p>

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a)	In a regular decagon, we draw all sides, all small diagonals $($connecting every other vertex$)$, and all large diagonals $($connecting all opposite vertices$)$.
<p>
b)	$50 \times 5$/2 = 125.
<p>
c) If there are n cities in the country, then 46 = 5n/2. But 46 is not divisible by 5.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a)	125 airlines; c) No, there cannot be.
</p>
