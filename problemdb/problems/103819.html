<h1>Problem ID 103819</h1>
<p>
In Mexico, environmentalists have succeeded in enacting a law whereby every car should not be driven at least one day a week (the owner informs the police about their car registration number and the day of the week when this car will not be driven). In a certain family, all adults want to travel daily (each for their own business!). How many cars (at least) should the family have, if the family has
<p>
  a) 5 adults? b) 8 adults?

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
If every day no more than one car "rests", then the total number of cars cannot exceed 7.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
a) Five cars are not enough because the day when one of the cars "rests", someone has no car to drive. Six cars are obviously enough.
<p>
b) If every day no more than one car "rests", then the total number of cars cannot exceed the number of days in the week, that is, seven. But this, obviously, is not enough. So, on some day, two cars "rest", and on this day, you need at least 8 more cars. Therefore, in total we have 10. We have proved that fewer than ten cars will not do.
<p>
Ten cars are enough: for example, every working day two cars "rest".

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
a) 6; b) 10 cars.
