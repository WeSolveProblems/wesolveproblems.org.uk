<h1>Problem ID 103027</h1>
<p>
Decipher the following rebus $($ see the figure $)$. Despite the fact that only two figures are known here, and all others are replaced by asterisks, the example can be restored.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
What are the second and fourth digits of the quotient? What are the first and last digits of the quotient equal to?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
From the arrangement of the asterisks in the rebus one can at once conclude that the second and fourth digits of the quotient are zeros. The divisor multiplied by 8 gives a two-digit number, and when multiplied by the first and fifth digits of the quotient, it is a three-digit number, then the first and last digits of the quotient are 9, and in all the quotient is equal to 90809. We find the divisor. This is a two-digit number that, when multiplied by 8, gives a two-digit number, and when multiplied by 9, it gives a three-digit number. Hence it is easy to conclude that the divisor is 12. And the whole example has the form - 1089708/ 12 = 90809.
