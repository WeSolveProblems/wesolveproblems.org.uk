<h1>Problem ID 110166</h1>
<p>
A set of weights has the following properties:
</p>
It contains 5 weights, which are all different in weight.
<p>
For any two weights, there are two other weights of the same total weight.
<p>
What is the smallest number of weights that can be in this set?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Let A be one of the lightest weights, and B one of the weights with the weight that is the next weight consecutively after A. Obviously, a pair of weights {A, B} can be balanced only by the same pair.
</p>
Therefore, there are at least two weights of weight A and B. A pair {A, A} can also only be balanced by the same pair. Therefore, there are at least 4 weights of weight equal to A. For similar principles, there are at least 4 weights of the heaviest weight E and at least two weights of the previous weight D.
</p>
In addition, by assumption, there is at least one weight C, which is heavier than A and B and is lighter than D and E.
Thus, the total number of weights in the set is no fewer than 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 13.
 </p>
On the other hand, it is also easy to verify that a set of 13 weights: {1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,5} satisfies the condition of the problem.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
13
