<h1>Problem ID 56543</h1>
<p>
From an arbitrary point M lying within a given angle with vertex A, the perpendiculars MP and MQ are dropped to the sides of the angle. From point A, the perpendicular AK is dropped to the segment PQ. Prove that $\angle$PAK = $\angle$MAQ.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Points P and Q lie on a circle with diameter AM. Therefore $\angle$QMA = $\angle$QPA as these angles are subtended from one arc. The triangles PAK and MAQ are right-angled, hence $\angle$PAK = $\angle$MAQ.
