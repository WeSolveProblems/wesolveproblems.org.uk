<h1>Problem ID 58107</h1>
<p>
  a) A square of area 6 contains three polygons, each of area 3. Prove that among them there are two polygons that have an overlap of area no less than 1.
</p>
<p>
  b)A square of area 5 contains nine polygons of area 1. Prove that among them there are two polygons that have an overlap of area no less than $\frac{1}{9}$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  a) Let there be three polygons $K, L, M$ Assume that each possible pair of polygons has an overlapping area of less than 1. This implies that the area of $K\cup L$ is greater than $3+3-1=5$.
</p>
<p>
  The total area of the part of $M$ which overlaps with $K\cup L$ must be less than 2 - a maximum overlap of area 1 for each of $K$ and $L$ - and the area of the non-overlapping area of $M$ must be less than $6-5=1$. This contradicts the condition that the area of $M$ is equal to 3.
</p>
<p>
  b) Assume that each possible pair of polygons $K_1, ..., K_9$ has an overlapping area of less than $ \frac{1}{9}$. Hence the area of $K_1 \cup K_2$ is greater than $1+1-\frac{1}{9} = 2 - \frac{1}{9}$. The area of the polygon $K_3$ which overlaps with $K_1 \cup K_2$ is less than $\frac{2}{9}$, so the area of $K_1 \cup K_2 \cup K_3$ is greater than $ (2 - \frac{1}{9})+ (1-\frac{2}{9}) = 3- \frac{1+2}{9}$
</p>
<p>
  Continuing using analogous reasoning, we get that the area of $K_1 \cup K_2 \cup ... \cup K_9$ is greater than $9- \frac{1+2+...+8}{9} = 5$. This is a contradiction.
