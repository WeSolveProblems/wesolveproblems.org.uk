<h1>Problem ID 88292</h1>
<p>
The vendor has a cup weighing scales with unequal shoulders and weights. First he weighs the goods on one cup, then on the other, and takes the average weight. Is he deceiving customers?
 
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suppose we put an item weighing 1 kg on the left-hand side of the scale, and weight weighing a kg in the other bowl for balance, that is, a times more. If we transfer the goods to the right cup, then for equilibrium on the left we will have to put a weight a times smaller, that is 1 / a kg. Thus, the seller will take the amount of money for

 kg, which, according to the Cauchy inequality, is more than 1 kg.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes he deceives customers.
