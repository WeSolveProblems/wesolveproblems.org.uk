<h1>Problem ID 61543</h1>
<p>
We denote by S the sum of the following series:
S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 -...       $(12.1)$
<p>
By transforming equation $(12.1)$, we can obtain the equation from which S is found:
<p>
$S = 1 - (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...) = 1 - S \Rightarrow S = ½$.
<p>
The sum S can also be found by combining the terms of the series $(12.1)$ into pairs:
$S = (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ... = 0 + 0 + ... = 0$;
<p>
$S = 1 - (1 - 1) - (1 - 1) -... = 1 - 0 - 0 -... = 1$.
<p>
Finally, rearranging the neighbouring summands, we obtain one more value of S:
<p>
$S = - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = - 1 + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ... = - 1$.
<p>
So, acting in four different ways, we found four values of the sum S:
<p>
S = ½ = 0 = 1 = - 1.
<p>
What is the value that the sum S takes in reality?

Nothing to translate.
