<h1>Problem ID 35170</h1>
<p>
 On a board of size $8 \times 8$, two in turn colour the cells so that there are no corners of three coloured squares. The player who can't make a move loses. Who wins with the right strategy?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Apply a symmetric strategy.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The second player wins if he makes moves symmetrical to the first player $($relative to the center of the board$)$. In fact, playing in this way, he can always make a move, and during his turn a painted corner cannot appear - otherwise it would have appeared on the previous move.
