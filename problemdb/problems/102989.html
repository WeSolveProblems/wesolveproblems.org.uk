<h1>Problem ID 102989</h1>
<p>
In a bookcase, there are four volumes of the collected works of Astrid Lindgren, with each volume containing 200 pages. A worm who lives on this bookshelf has gnawed its way from the first page of the first volume to the last page of the fourth volume. Through how many pages has the worm gnawed its way through?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1> 
<p>
Try to remember that the volumes on the bookshelf are from the collected works.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Note, when the volumes are on the shelf in order, the first page of the 1st volume touches the last page of the 2nd volume, and the last page of the 4th volume touches the first page of the 3rd volume. Thus, the worm gnawed through only the 2nd and 3rd volumes, i.e. 400 pages.
