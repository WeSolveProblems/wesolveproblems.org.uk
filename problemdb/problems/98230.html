<h1>Problem ID 98230</h1>
<p>
  A village infant school has 20 pupils. If we pick any two pupils they will have a shared granddad.
</p>
<p>
  Prove that one of the granddads has no fewer than 14 grandchildren who are pupils at this school.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider any pupil $A$ and both of their granddads $X$ and $Y$. If not all of the pupils in the school are grandchildren of one of them $($in which case there is nothing more to prove$)$ then there is a pupil $B$ who is not a grandchild of $X$ and therefore must be a grandchild of $Y$, and a pupil $C$ who is not a grandchild of $Y$ and therefore must be a grandchild of $X$. The pupils $B$ and $C$ must have a shared granddad $Z$.
</p>
<p>
  There can be no more granddads other than $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ in the class as the grandchild of any further granddad would not have a shared granddad with one of the pupils $A$, $B$ or $C$. So we must distribute 20 grandchildren amongst 3 granddads, bearing in mind that each grandchild has two granddads, meaning that one granddad has no fewer than $ \frac{2}{3} \times 20$ grandchildren, that is no fewer than 14 grandchildren.
