<h1>Problem ID 98403</h1>
<p>
12 mayor candidates talked about themselves. After a while, one said: "The number of lies told me before me was one." Another said: "And now - two". "And now - three," said the third, and so on until the 12th, who said: "And now they lied 12 times." Then the presenter interrupted the discussion. It turned out that at least one candidate correctly calculated how many lies were told before him. So, how many times have the candidates lied?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the last candidate to tell the truth be the k-th one. Then the number of lies before him was k, and after him: 12 - k lies.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
12 lies.
</p>


<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
	1. It is not difficult to verify that there was exactly one right candidate, and the first one was the one that was right.
<p>
4 points.
