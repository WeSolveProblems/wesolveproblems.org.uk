<h1>Problem ID 89927</h1>
<p>
In the language of the Ancient Tribe, the alphabet consists of only two letters: M and O. Two words are synonyms, if one can be obtained by from the other by
a$)$ the deletion of the letters MO or OOMM,
b$)$ adding in any place the letter combination of OM.
Are the words OMM and MOO synonyms in the language of the Ancient Tribe?
 
</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Note that the difference between the numbers of the letters M and O does not change when adding or deleting allowed letters.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
When adding or deleting allowed letters, the difference between the numbers of letters of M and O does not change. Therefore, it is equal to 1 for synonyms of the word OMM and -1 for synonyms of the word MOO. Hence, these words are not synonymous.
