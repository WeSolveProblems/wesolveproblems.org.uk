<h1>Problem ID 104009</h1>
<p>
 The king made a test for the future groom of his daughter. He put the princess in one of three rooms, a tiger in the other, and left the last room empty. It is known that the sign on the door where the princess is sitting is true, where the tiger is - it is false, and nothing is known about the sign on the third room. The tablets are as follows:
<p>
1 - room 3 is empty
<p>
2 - the tiger is in room 1 
<p>
3 - this room is empty
<p>
Can the prince correctly guess the room with the princess?
