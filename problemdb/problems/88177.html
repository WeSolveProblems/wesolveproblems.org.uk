<h1>Problem ID 88177</h1>
<p>
When three friends - Nadia, Elena and Olga - went out for a walk, they were wearing white, red and blue dresses. Their shoes were of the same three colours, but only Nadia had the same shoe and dress colour. At the same time, neither Elena’s dress, nor her shoes were blue, and Olga was wearing red shoes. Determine the colour of the dresses and of the shoes of each friend.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Elena has white shoes - why? Remember problem number 132.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Elena’s shoes are not blue $($by condition$)$ and not red $($Olga has the red ones$)$, therefore, Elena has white shoes; Nadia, thus, has the remaining blue shoes. This in turn means that Nadia has a blue dress $($by the condition of the problem, the colours of Nadia’s shoes and dress coincide$)$. Then Elena has a red dress, and Olga has a white dress $($because they have shoes and dresses of different colours, and not blue as Nadia has the blue shoes and dress$)$. So: Nadia has blue shoes and a blue dress; Elena’s shoes are white and her dress is red; Olga’s shoes are red and her dress is white. 

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
Nadia has blue shoes and a blue dress; Elena’s shoes are white and her dress is red; Olga’s shoes are red and her dress is white.
