<h1>Problem ID 65319</h1>
<p>
The television game "What? Where? When?" consists of a team of "experts" trying to solve 13 questions that are thought up and sent in by the viewers of the programme. Envelopes with the questions are selected in turn in random order with the help of a spinning top with an arrow. If the experts answer correctly, they earn a point, and if they answer incorrectly, the viewers get one point. The game ends as soon as one of the teams scores 6 points. The probability of the team of experts winning in one round is 0.6 and there can be no draws. Currently, the experts are losing 3 to 4. Find the probability that the experts will still win.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  To win, the experts must win three rounds in a row $(the probability of this is 0.6^3)$ or lose exactly one of the next three rounds and then win the 11th round $(the probability of this is 3 \times 0.6^2 \times 0.4 \times 0.6 = 3 \times 0.6^3 \times 0.4)$.
<p>
  So, the probability of a victory for the team of experts is $0.6^3 + 3 \times 0.6^3 \times 0.4 = 0.4752$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
0.4752.
