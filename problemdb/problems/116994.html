<h1>Problem ID 116994</h1>
<p>
Let $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$ be some numbers belonging to the interval [0, 1]. Prove that on this segment there is a number x such that
$\frac{1}{n} (|x - x_1| + |x - x_2| + ... + |x - x_n|) = 1/2$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Consider the function f $($x$)$ = $\frac{1}{n} (|x - x_1| + |x - x_2| + ... + |x - x_n|)$ on the interval [0, 1]. It is continuous. Let's consider two of its values:
<p>
f $($0$)$ = $\frac{1}{n} (|x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_n|)$ and f $($1$)$ = $\frac{1}{n} (|1 - x_1| + |1 - x_2| + ... + |1 - x_n|)$. Since |x| + |1 - x| = 1 for any x in the interval [0, 1], then
f $($0$)$ + f $($1$)$ = 1.
If f $($0$)$ = f $($1$)$ = 1/2, then the equality is valid for both x = 0 and x = 1. If one of these numbers is less than 1/2, then the other is greater than 1/2. Then, by the intermediate value theorem, f $($x$)$ = 1/2, for some x in the interval [0, 1].
