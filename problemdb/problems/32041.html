<h1>Problem ID 32041</h1>
<p>A group of 20 tourists go on a trip. The oldest member of the group is 35, the youngest is 20. Is it true that there are members of the group that are the same age?</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>What value can the age of each of the tourists have? Obviously, one of the numbers 20, 21, 22...,35 which gives a total of 16 possibilities. Thus if we hypothesise that the ages of any two tourists are different, the group must contain no more than 16 people. But the problem states that there are 20 tourists. Therefore there must be people of the same age in the group. </p>
