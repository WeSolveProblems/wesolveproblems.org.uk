<h1>Problem ID 64487</h1>
<p>
Specify any solution of the puzzle: 2014 + YES =BEAR.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
From the addition of hundreds, it follows that the addition of tens is accomplished when O = 8 or O = 9. In both cases, B = 2.
<p>
In the first case, Y = 7, A = 0. For S, the values 6 and 9 remain, but a quick check shows that only 9 is suitable.
In the second case, Y = 8, A = 0 or 1. The possible values of S are found by trial and error.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
2014 + 789 = 2803, 2014 + 896 = 2910, 2014 + 891 = 2905, 2014 + 893 = 2907, 2014 + 896 = 2910.
