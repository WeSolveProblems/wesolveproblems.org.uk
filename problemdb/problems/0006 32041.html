<h1>Problem</h1>
A group of 20 tourists goes on a trip. The oldest member of the group is 35, the youngest is 20. Is it true, that there are members of the group that are the same age?
<h1>Solution</h1>
What value can the age of each of the tourists have? Obviously, one of the numbers 20, 21, 22...,35 (a total of 16 possibilities) Thus if we hypothesise, that the ages of any two tourists are different, the group can contain no more than 16 people. But the problem states that there are in fact 20. Therefore there must be people of the same age in the group.
