<h1>Problem ID 98025</h1>
<p>
PFind the number of solutions in natural numbers of the equation [x / 10] = [x / 11] + 1.
</p>

<h1>Solution 1</h1> 
<p>
Let x = 11n + r, where n $≥$ 0, 0 $≤$ r $≤$ 10. Then, [x / 11] = n, n + 1 = [x / 10] = n + [$($n + r$)$ / 10], that is, 10 $≤$ n + r $<$ 20, 10 - r $≤$ n $≤$ 19 - r. For each r from 0 to 10, we get 10 solutions.
</p>

<h1>Solution 2</h1> 
<p>
If x $≥$ 220, then x / 10 $≥$ 2 + x / 11, therefore the integer parts of the numbers x / 10 and x / 11 differ by at least 2. If x $<$ 220, then these integer parts differ by no more than 2. Note that if [x / 10] = [x / 11] + a, then [$($x + 110$)$/10] = [$($x + 110$)$/11] + a + 1. This implies that exactly one number from the pair {x, x + 110} $($x $<$110$)$ is the solution of our equation. Thus, it has exactly 220/2 = 110 solutions.
