<h1>Problem ID 88150</h1>
<p>
Dave spent the first Tuesday of the month in Bath, and the first Tuesday after the first Monday in Cardiff. The following month Dave spent the first Tuesday in London, and the first Tuesday after the first Monday in Cambridge. Can you determine what month and date Dave was in each of the cities?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Why did the month in which Dave was in Bath and Cardiff, begin on a Tuesday?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Since Dave could not spend the same day in Bath and in Cardiff, this means that the month started on a Tuesday $($otherwise the first Tuesday and the first Tuesday after the first Monday would have coincided$)$. Similarly, we conclude that the second month should also begin on a Tuesday. This is possible only if one month is February, and another is March, and the year is not a leap year. Hence, now it is easy to see that Dave was in Bath on $1^{st}$ February, in Cardiff on $8^{th}$ February, in London on $1^{st}$ March and in Cambridge on $8^{th}$ March.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
In Bath on $1^{st}$ February, in Cardiff on $8^{th}$ February, in London on $1^{st}$ March and in Cambridge on $8^{th}$ March.
