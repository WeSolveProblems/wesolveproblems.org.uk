<h1>Problem ID 111417</h1>
<p>
The height SO of a regular quadrilateral pyramid SABCD forms an angle Î± with a side edge and the volume of this pyramid is equal to V. The vertex of the second regular quadrangular pyramid is at the point S, the centre of the base is at the point C, and one of the vertices of the base lies on the line SO. Find the volume of the common part of these pyramids.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>  
Nothing to translate. 

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
 $\frac{V} {2(1+cos a)}$.
