<h1>Problem ID 22001</h1>
<p>
  11 scouts are working on 5 different badges. Prove that there will be two scouts $A$ and $B$, such that every badge that $A$ is working towards is also being worked towards by $B$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let us number the 5 possible badges from 1 to 5. Instead of the scouts, we will consider the subset of badges each scout is working towards out of the set ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. It remains only to divide the 32 possible subsets of the given set into 10 groups, so that in each of the groups in any of the two subsets contained within it one includes the other. To achieve this we can consider the following groups: $[âˆ…, {1}, {1,2}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4,5}], [{2}, {2,5}, {1,2,5}, {1,2,3,5}], [{3}, {1,3}, {1,3,4}, {1,3,4,5}], [{4}, {1,4}, {1,2,4}, {1,2,4,5}], [{5}, {1,5}, {1,3,5}], [{2,4}, {2,4,5}, {2,3,4,5}], [{3,4}, {3,4,5}], [{3,5}, {2,3,5}], [{4,5}, {1,4,5}], [{2,3}, {2,3,4}]$.
