<h1>Problem ID 58313</h1> <p>
Ten circles are marked on the circle. How many non-closed non-self-intersecting nine-point broken lines exist with vertices at these points?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The first point can be selected in ten ways. Each of the following eight points can be selected in two ways: it must be adjacent to one of the previously selected points $($otherwise a self-intersecting polyline will be obtained$)$. Since the beginning and the end differ in this calculation, but this does not happen with the polyline, the result must be divisible by 2. Consequently, there are $10 \times 2^8 \div 2 = 1280$ broken lines.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
1280 broken lines.
