<h1>Problem ID 65704</h1>
<p>
Author: G. Zhukov
<p>
The square trinomial $f (x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ that does not have roots is such that the coefficient b is rational, and among the numbers c and $f (c)$ there is exactly one irrational.
Can the discriminant of the trinomial $f (x)$ be rational?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Since the trinomial $f (x)$ does not have roots, it follows that $c = f (0) ≠ 0$ and $f (c) ≠ 0$. Hence $f (c)/c$ is irrational as is the ratio of rational and irrational numbers. But $f (c)/c = ac + b + 1$. Since b + 1 is rational, then ac is irrational. Consequently, the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is irrational as it is the difference between rational and irrational numbers.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
No, it cannot.
