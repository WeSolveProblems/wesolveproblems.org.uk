<h1>Problem ID 110047</h1>
<p>
Nonzero numbers a and b satisfy the equality $a^2b^2$ $(a^2b^2 + 4)$ = 2$(a^6 + b^6)$. Prove that at least one of them is irrational.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Rewriting the equality in the form $(a^4 - 2b^2)$ $(b^4 - 2a^2)$ = 0, we find that either 
$(\frac{a^2}{b})^2$
or 
$(\frac{b^2}{a})^2$
 
As is known, both equalities are impossible for rational numbers a and b.
