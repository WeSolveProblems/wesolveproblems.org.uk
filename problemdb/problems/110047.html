<h1>Problem ID 110047</h1>
<p>
Nonzero numbers a and b satisfy the equality $a^2b^2$ $(a^2b^2 + 4)$ = 2$(a^6 + b^6)$. Prove that at least one of them is irrational.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Rewriting the equality in the form $(a^4 - 2b^2)$ $(b^4 - 2a^2)$ = 0, we find that either 
$(\frac{a^2}{b})^2$
or 
$(\frac{b^2}{a})^2$
 
As is known, both equalities are impossible for rational numbers a and b.

The real numbers x and y are such that for any distinct prime odd p and q the number $x^p$ + $y^q$ is rational. Prove that x and y are rational numbers.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
From the rationality of $x^p$ + $y^q$, $x^r$ + $y^q$, $x^s$ + $y^q$, the rationality of the numbers $x^r$ - $x^p$, $x^s$ - $x^r$ follows. We take p = 3, r = 5, s = 7. Then a = $x^7$ - $x^5$ and b = $x^5$ - $x^3$ are rational. If b = 0, then x = 0 or x = ± 1, that is, x is rational. If b ≠ 0, then x² = a / b is rational. But then the equality b = $x^2$ $(x^2 - 1)$x implies the rationality of x. Similarly, y is a rational number.
