<h1>Problem ID 89913</h1>
<p>
Jemima always tells the truth, but when she was asked the same question twice, she gave different answers. What kind of question could this be?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Remember task 89912.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Jemimaâ€™s second answer differs from the first, which means that something has changed. What? Only the situation, for example, the number of questions asked or the time. Accordingly, possible questions are: "How many questions have I already asked you?", Or: "What time is it, to the nearest second?".
