<h1>Problem ID 35578</h1>
<p>
In how many ways can you rearrange the numbers from 1 to 100 so that the neighbouring numbers differ by no more than 1?




<p>

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Where can the number 1 stand?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Next to the number 1 only the number 2 can be located, so 1 stands at the beginning or at the end of the sequence. Suppose that 1 is at the beginning. Then the next number is 2, the next number is 3 $($there cannot be other numbers next to 2$)$, the next number is 4, etc. We get the arrangement 1, 2, ..., 99, 100. If 1 is located at the end, then the arrangement 100, 99, ..., 2, 1 is restored unequivocally.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
In two ways.
