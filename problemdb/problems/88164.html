<h1>Problem ID 88164</h1>
<p>
Colin always tells the truth, but Dave always lies. What question should they be asked, so that they would give the same answers?

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Remember problem number 140.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
As in Problem 140, the question should relate to a characteristic that is true of one of the boys $($for example, Colin$)$ and is incorrect for the other. There are 2 characteristics, according to the conditions of the problem: name and honesty. Therefore, there can be two questions in the simplest form: "Do you always tell the truth?" or: "Are you called Colin?" If you want, you can complicate any of these questions indefinitely, for example: "Does your friend tell the truth?" or "Is your friend's name Colin?" or "Are you more honest than your friend?" etc. It is interesting to compare the questions: "Are you more honest than Dave?" and "Are you more honest than Colin?". To the first question, both of the boys will respond identically - "yes", and to the second - differently, for Colin cannot be more honest than himself and, like an honest person, he recognises this.

<h1>Answer</h1>
"Is your name Colin?"
