<h1>Problem ID 115488</h1>
<p>
Which numbers can stand in place of the letters in the equality $AB \times C$ = DE, if different letters denote different numbers and from left to right the numbers are written in ascending order?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let us consider the greatest possible values of the number DE. The numbers 89 and 79 are prime, so do not fit. Next, consider the number 78, we will go over its single-digit divisors and get the answer. Further search can be made to make sure that this answer is the only one.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
$13 \times 6$ = 78.
