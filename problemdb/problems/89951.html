<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  The smell of a flowering lavender plant diffuses through a radius of 20m around it. How many lavender plants must be planted along a straight 400m path, so that the lavender could be smelled at every point on the path.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Notice, that in order to fulfill the conditions of the problem, the distance between adjacent plants must be no greater than 40m
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  In each 40m segment of the path, there must be one plant. The 400m path must contain exactly 10 such segments, therefore we need 10 plants (the plant is planted at the centre of each segment). We would have the first plant 20m from the start of the path, and the last 20m before the end, with the rest being at 40m intervals.
