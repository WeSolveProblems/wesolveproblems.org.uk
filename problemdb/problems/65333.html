<h1>Problem ID 65333</h1>
<p>
Prince Charming, and another 49 men and 50 women are randomly seated around a round table. Let's call a man satisfied, if a woman is sitting next to him. Find:
<p>
a$)$ the probability that Prince Charming is satisfied;
<p>
b$)$ the mathematical expectation of the number of satisfied men.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
a$)$ Prince Charming is dissatisfied only if men are sitting on either side of him. The probability of this is $49/99 \times 48/98$ = 8/33. Consequently, the probability of the opposite event "Prince Charming is satisfied" is equal to 25/33.
<p>
b$)$ The probability that one man is satisfied is 25/33. This is the mathematical expectation of the number of contented men among one man. Then among 50 men the mathematical expectation of the number of satisfied ones is $50 \times 25/33$ = 1250/33.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a$)$ 25/33; b$)$ 37 + 29/33.
