<h1>Problem ID 35708</h1>
<p>
The positive irrational numbers a and b are such that 1/a + 1/b = 1. Prove that among the numbers [ma], [nb] each natural number occurs exactly once.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Prove that among the numbers of the form ma and nb for positive integers m and n, k-1 is exactly a number less than k. 

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Let us prove that among numbers of the form ma and nb for positive integers m and n, k-1 is exactly a number less than k. Applying this statement for k = 1, 2, ..., we obtain that in each interval from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, ..., from k-1 to k exactly one number of the form [ma] or [nb] is added. So, let's set some natural k. We find the numbers M and N such that Ma $<$ k $<$ $(M + 1)$ a and Nb $<$ k $<$ $(N + 1)$ b. $(Here we have the right to take strict inequalities, since a and b are irrational numbers.)$ Then there are exactly M + N numbers of the form [ma] or [nb] less than k. In fact, the number [ma] is less than k exactly for m = 1, 2, ..., M; and likewise, the number [nb] is less than k exactly for b = 1, 2, ..., N. It remains to understand that M + N = k-1. We divide the inequalities Ma $<$ k $<$ $(M + 1)$ a and Nb $<$ k $<$ $(N + 1)$ b by a and b, respectively, and then add them. We obtain: $M + N $<$k/a + k/b $<$M + N + 2$. By the condition k/a + k/b = 1, therefore $M + N $<$k $<$M + N + 2$. Thus, the natural number k is enclosed between the natural numbers M + N and M + N + 2. Hence, uniquely k = M + N + 1, i.e. M + N = k-1, which is what we wanted to prove.
