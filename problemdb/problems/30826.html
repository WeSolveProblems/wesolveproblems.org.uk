<h1>Problem ID 30826</h1>
<p>
Several teams played a volleyball tournament amongst themselves. We will say that team A is better than team B, if either A has either beaten team B, or there exists such a team C that was beaten by A, whilst C beat team B.
<p>
a$)$ Prove that there is a team that is better than all.
<p>
b$)$ Prove that the team that won the tournament is the best.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
b$)$ Let team A win the tournament. If there is a team B that beat both A and all the teams which lost to A, then this team has more points than A, which is impossible. This gives a contradiction.
