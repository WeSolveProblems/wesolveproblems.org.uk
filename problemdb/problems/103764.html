<h1>Problem ID 103764</h1>
<p>
Uncle Jack, the cat Whiskers, Spot and postman Pat are sitting on a bench. If Spot, sitting to the right of everyone, sits between Uncle Jack and the cat, then the cat will be at the extreme left. In what order do they sit?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Whiskers was the last to the left before the rearrangement.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
By the condition in the question, Spot is at the far right. In particular, he sits to the right of Whiskers. After Spotâ€™s movement, no one was left to the left of Whiskers. Hence, there was no one there! That is, Whiskers is at the extreme left. Next to him, by the condition, is Uncle Jack. And then, in the only remaining free place is the postman.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
$($From left to right$)$ Whiskers, Uncle Jack, Pat, Spot.
