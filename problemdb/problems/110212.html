<h1>Problem ID 110212</h1>
<p>
Author: V.A. Senderov

For what natural numbers n are there positive rational but not whole numbers a and b, such that both a + b and $a^n + b^n$ are integers?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  If n is odd, then we set a = ½, b = ½ $(2^n - 1)$. Then $a + b = 2^{n-1}$, and $a^n + b^n = (a + b) (a^{n-1}-a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1})$. The denominator of the fraction in parentheses is $2^{n-1}$, therefore the number $a^n + b^n$ is also an integer.
<p>
  Let n be even. Suppose that the required numbers a and b are found. Since their sum is an integer, the denominators in their irreducible notation are equal, that is, their irreducible record is as follows: a = p/d, b = q/d; and p + q is a multiple of d.
  Since the number <img src="110212 1.gif"> is integer, $p^n + q^n$ is divisible by d. But $p^n + q^n = (p^n – q^n) + 2q^n$, and $p^n – q^n$ is divisible by a multiple of d:
<p>
$p^2 – q^2 = (p + q) (p - q)$. Hence, $2q^n$ is divisible by d. Since the fraction q/d is uncancellable, then 2 is divisible by d, that is, d = 2. But then $p^n$ and $q^n$ are the squares of odd numbers, which hence give the remainder 1 when dividing by 4. Therefore $p^n + q^n$ is not divisible by 4, and more so, by $2^n$. This is a contradiction.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
For all odd n.
