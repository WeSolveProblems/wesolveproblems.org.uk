<h1>Problem ID 30445</h1>
<p>
a)	Two in turn put bishops in the cells of a chessboard. The next move must beat at least one empty cell. The bishop also beats the cell in which it is located. The player who loses is the one who cannot make a move. 
<p>
b) Repeat the same, but with rooks.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
In both games, the second player wins.
<p>
a)	Axial symmetry.
<p>
b) Central symmetry. The decisive consideration is that if two symmetric cells are not beaten, then the cell from which they both beat are also not beaten.
