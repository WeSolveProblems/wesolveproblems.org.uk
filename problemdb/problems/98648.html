<h1>Problem ID 98648</h1>
<p>
Elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes. In all zoos where there are elephants and rhinoceroses, there are no giraffes. In all zoos where there are rhinoceroses and there are no giraffes, there are elephants. Finally, in all zoos where there are elephants and giraffes, there are also rhinoceroses. Could there be a zoo in which there are elephants, but there are no giraffes and no rhinoceroses?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think about whether there are any requirements in the task for zoos where there are elephants, but there are no giraffes.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Such a zoo, indeed, can exist. There are no conditions for zoos in which there are elephants, but there are no giraffes, or there are elephants, but there are no rhinoceroses.
