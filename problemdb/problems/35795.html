<h1>Problem ID 35795</h1>
<p>
  A straight corridor of length 100m is covered with 20 rugs that have a total length of 1km. The width of each rug is equal to the width of the corridor. What is the longest possible total length of corridor that is not covered by a rug? 
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  What is the minimum length of the longest rug?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  We will prove that no more than 50m can remain uncovered. In fact, of the 20 rugs with a total length of $20 \times 50=1000$ at least one must have a length of no less than 50m - if every rug was shorter than 50m, then the total length of the rugs would be less than 1km. In this way the rugs will cover at least 50m of the corridor.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand if we take 20 rugs each of length 50m and place them on top of one another, then the total length of the rugs will be 1km, but 50m of the corridor will not be covered by a rug.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>50m. </p>
