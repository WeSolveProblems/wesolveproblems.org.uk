<h1>Problem ID 60431</h1>
<p>
How many six-digit numbers exist that are divisible by 5?
</p>

<h1>Solution 1</h1>
<p>
There are 90000 five-digit numbers $($see the solution of problem number 60336$)$. To each of them, in order to obtain a six-digit number that is a multiple of 5, you need to add a 0 or a 5 at the end.

</p>


<h1>Solution 2</h1>
<p>
In every five consecutive numbers, exactly one is multiple of 5. Therefore, the number of six-digit numbers, that are multiples of 5, is five times less than the total number of all six-digit numbers. And there are 900000 of them.
</p>



<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
180000 numbers.
