<h1>Problem ID 109196</h1>
<p>
In the number a = 0.12457 ... the nth digit after the decimal point is equal to the digit to the left of the decimal point in the number. Prove that Î± is an irrational number.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suppose this it is not so: 0.12457 ... is a periodic decimal fraction with a length of period m $($and some preperiod$)$. Then the numbers standing on the places with the numbers m, 10m, 100m, ..., $10^{k}m$, ..., coincide $($for numbers longer than the pre-period$)$. At the same time, these are successive digits of the decimal expansion of the irrational number $($that is, the non-periodic fraction$)$. Therefore we have a contradiction.
