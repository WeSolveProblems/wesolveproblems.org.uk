<h1>Problem ID 88072</h1>
<p>
  a) Prove that within any 6 whole numbers there will be two that have a difference between them that is a multiple of 5.
</p>
<p>
  b) Will this statement remain true if instead of the difference we considered the total?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  a) See Problem id 21972
</p>
<p>
  b) If, for example, all 5 numbers give remainder 1 when divided by 5 then the total of any two of them will give a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 - that is, it will not be divisible by 5.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  b) No.
