<h1>Problem ID 32817</h1>
<p>
a)	There are 10 coins. It is known that one of them is fake $($by weight, it is heavier than the real ones$)$. How can you determine the counterfeit coin with three weighings on scales without weights?
<p>
    b) How can you determine the counterfeit coin with three weighings, if there are 27 coins?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
a)	Put a pile of five coins on each side of the scales. From the pile that is heavier $($a false coin is sure to be there$)$, we put two coins on each side of the scales. If the masses of the sides are equal, then the fake coin is the fifth one from the heavier pile; otherwise we put on the scales on a coin from the heavier pile $($a fake coin is definitely among them$)$. Therefore, the coin that is heavier is the fake one.
<p>
b)	We divide the coins into 3 piles of 9 coins. Put the first and second piles on the scales; by the result of this weighing we know exactly which of the piles contains the fake coin $($if the scales are in equilibrium then the fake coin is in the third pile$)$. Now, likewise, we divide the selected pile into three parts of three coins, put two of these parts on the scales and determine which part contains the counterfeit coin. Finally, it remains to determine the heavier of the three coins. We put one coin on each side of the scales. The false coin is the heavier one. If the scales are in equilibrium, the fake coin is the third coin from the pile.
