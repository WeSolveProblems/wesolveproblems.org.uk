<h1>Problem ID 88120</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to fill a $5 \times 5$ table with numbers so that the sum of the numbers in each row is positive and the sum of the numbers in each column is negative?
<p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to calculate the sum of all of the numbers in the table.</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If this were possible, the sum of all of the numbers in the table, counted "by rows," would be positive, and "by columns" - negative, which is impossible.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
No, it is not possible.
