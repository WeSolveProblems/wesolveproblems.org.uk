<h1>Problem ID 88010</h1>
<p>
In the rebus in the diagram below, the arithmetic operations are carried out from left to right &#40;even though the brackets are not written&#41;. 
<br>
For example, in the first row "$** \div 5 + * \times 7 = 4*$" is the same as "$&#40;&#40;** \div 5&#41; +*&#41; \times 7 = 4*$". Each number in the last row is the sum of the numbers in the column above it.

The result of each $n$-th row is equal to the sum of the first four numbers in the $n$-th column.

All of the numbers in this rebus are non-zero and do not begin with a zero, however they could end with a zero. That is, 10 is allowed but not 01 or 0. Solve the rebus.

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Did you use the condition that the results of the rows and columns with the same number are equal? What could the first four numbers in the first column be? What could be the first number of the first row? What could be the second number of the second row? What could the results of the first row &#40;and also of the first column&#41; be?

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We shall replace all the asterisks in the rebus with different letters. Note that the letter O is not used since it can cause confusion with the number zero. Also note that different letters could stand for the same number. Thus the rebus takes the following form.

<br>
We can determine the value of some of the letters straight away: U = 4 &#40;since the results of the rows and columns with the same number are equal&#41;. A = E = I = N = 1 &#40;since four two-digit numbers in the first column add to give a two-digit number beginning with 4, which is only possible if A, E, I, N are 1&#41;. B = 0 or 5 &#40;since 1B is divisible by 5&#41; but it cannot equal 5 since if B = 5 then the sum of the first column will be greater than 50. So B = 0. 4D is the result of multiplying by 7, but 4D is clearly greater than 42 which means that D = 9. From this we have that V = 9, J = 2, C = 5.
<br>
Now we will write out the rebus again with these letters replaced by the corresponding numbers, as shown below.

<br>
F = 2 or 7 &#40;since it is a divisor of 14&#41; but E cannot be equal to 7 since then the sum of the numbers in the second column would be greater than what we need, and so E = 2. P = 1 &#40;so that the sum of the second column will be a 1 digit number&#41;. From this we have that W = 9, H = 9, G = 3, Z = 1, $\alpha$ = 7. Also: S = 1, T = 7 &#40;since the result of the fourth row is equal to the sum of the fourth column&#41;. It follows that Q = 1, R = 0. Since the sum of the third column is equal to the result of the third row, we have that 5 + 4 + K + 10 = &#40;12 - 1 - K&#41; $\times$ 2, so K = 1. Then we can determine the rest of the letters: L = 2, M = 0, X = 2, Y = 0, $\beta$ = 9, $\gamma$ = 5. Therefore the solution is:
