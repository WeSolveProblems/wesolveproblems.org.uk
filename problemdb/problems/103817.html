<h1>Problem ID 103817</h1>
<p>
A family went to the bridge at night. The dad can cross over it in 1 minute, the mom can cross it in 2, the child takes 5 minutes, and grandmother in 10 minutes. They have one flashlight. The bridge can only withstands two people at a time. How can they all cross the bridge in 17 minutes? $($ If two people pass, then they go at the lower of their speeds. $)$ You can not move along a bridge without a flashlight. You can not shine it from a distance.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Here is the desired algorithm:
<p>
The father goes with mother in 2 min,
<p>
The dad goes back with a flashlight in 1 min,
<p>
The child goes with the grandmother in 10 min,
<p>
The mom goes back with the flashlight in 2 min,
<p>
The dad and mom cross in 2 min.
<p>
Only 17 minutes!

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
Ideology. We must get rid of the dogma that the flashlight should be back with the fastest moving person, that is, the dad. Then it is already easy to guess that you have to let grandmother and child go together.
