<h1>Problem ID 35662</h1>
<p>
What weights can three weights have so that they can weigh any integer number of kilograms from 1 to 10 on weighing scales $($weights can be put on both cups$)$? Give an example.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Make the necessary search of variants.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The fact that this set really allows you to weigh any integer number of kilograms from 1 to 10 is shown by the following equations: 1 = 4-3, 2 = 9-3-4, 3 = 3, 4 = 4, 5 = 9-4, 6 = 9-3, 7 = 3 + 4, 8 = 3-4 + 9, 9 = 9, 10 = 4 + 9-3.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
For example, weights of 3, 4, 9 kg.
