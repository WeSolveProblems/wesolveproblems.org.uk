<h1>Problem</h1>
A warehouse contains 200 boots of each of the sizes 8, 9 and 10. Amongst these 600 boots, 300 are left boots and 300 are right boots. Prove that there are at least 100 usable pairs of boots in the warehouse.

<h1>Solution</h1>
For each size, there are fewer boots of one type - either left or right. Let us consider which type has less for each size. In at least two sizes, the smaller number of boots will be of the same type (e.g.  left boots in sizes 8 and 9). Since the total number of left boots in these sizes is no less than 100 (as there can be at most 200 size 10 left boots), we have at least 100 usable pairs of boots in sizes 8 and 9 (where both the left and right boot are present).
