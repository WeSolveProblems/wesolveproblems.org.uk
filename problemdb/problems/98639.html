<h1>Problem ID 98639</h1>
<p>
So, the mother exclaimed - "It’s a miracle!", and immediately the mum, dad and the children went to the pet store. "But there are more than fifty bullfinches here, how will we decide?," the younger brother nearly cried when he saw bullfinches. "Don’t worry," said the eldest, "there are less than fifty of them". "The main thing," said the mother, "is that there is at least one!". "Yes, it's funny," Dad summed up, "of your three phrases, only one corresponds to reality." Can you say how many bullfinches there was in the store, knowing that they bought the child a bullfinch?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note: the younger brother saw the bullfinches.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since the younger brother saw the bullfinches, then the mother is right, then both brothers are wrong. And this means that there are no more than 50 bullfinches, and not less than 50. The only possibility was that the store had exactly 50 bullfinches.
