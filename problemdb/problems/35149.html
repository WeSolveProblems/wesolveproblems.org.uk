<h1>Problem ID 35149</h1>
<p>
In a square which has sides of length 1 there are 100 figures, the total area of which sums to more than 99. Prove that in the square there is a point which belongs to all of these figures.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
Consider the figures that complement the given 100 figures to complete the square.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Denote the given 100 figures as $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$,..., $A_{100}$, and their areas as $S_{1}$, $S_{2}$,..., $S_{100}$, respectively. By the condition, $S_{1}$ + $S_{2}$ + ... + $S_{100}$$<$99. Let us denote by $B_{i}$ a figure that complements the figure $A_{i}$ to complete the square (that is, it consists of all points of the square that do not belong to the figure $A_{i}$). Then the area of the figure $B_{i}$ is 1-$S_{i}$ (for i = 1,2,..., 100). Then the sum of the areas of the figures $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$, ..., $B_{100}$ is (1-$S_{1}$) + (1-$S_{2}$) + ... + (1-$S_{100}$) = 100 - ($S_{1}$ + $S_{2}$ + ... + $S_{100}$), which is less than 1. So, the sum of the areas of the figures $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$,..., $B_{100}$ is less than the area of the square. This means that there is a point in the square that does not belong to one of the figures $B_{1}$, $B_{2}$,..., $B_{100}$. Therefore, this point belongs to each of the figures $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$,..., $A_{100}$.
