<h1>Problem ID 35563</h1>
<p>
Each of the three cutlets should be fried in a pan on both sides for five minutes each side. Only two cutlets can fit onto the frying pan. Is it possible to fry all three cutlets more quickly than in 20 minutes $($if the time to turn over and transfer the cutlets is neglected$)$?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
It is not necessary to fry the cutlet on one side immediately followed by the other side. 
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In the first 5 minutes, letâ€™s fry the first two cutlets on one side. Then turn the first cutlet over, remove the second from the pan and put in the third. Fry for another 5 minutes. Now the first cutlet is ready, and the second and third are done on one side. Within the next five minutes, fry the second and third cutlets on the other, not-cooked side.


</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
15 minutes.
