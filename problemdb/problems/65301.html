<h1>Problem ID 65301</h1>
<p>
The length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is 3.
<p>
a$)$ The Scattered Scientist calculated the dispersion of the lengths of the sides of this triangle and found that it equals 2. Was he wrong in the calculations?
<p>
b$)$ What is the smallest standard deviation of the sides that a rectangular triangle can have? What are the lengths of its sides, adjacent to the right angle?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a$)$ Let a and b be the sides of the triangle, adjacent to the right angle. Then $a^2$ + $b^2$ = 9, and D = 1/3 $($a^2$ + $b^2$ + 9$)$ - 1/9 $($a + b + 3$)$^2$ = 18/3 - 1/9$($a + b + 3$)$^2$ = 6 - 1/9 $($a + b + 3$)$^2$. It follows from the triangle inequality that a + b $>$ 3. Hence, D $<$ 6 - $1/9 \times 6^2$ = 2.
<p>
b$)$ From the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the mean quadratic it follows that.

 of the lengths of the three sides does not exceed

This least value is achieved only if the dispersion of the sides adjacent to the right angle is zero, that is, if
