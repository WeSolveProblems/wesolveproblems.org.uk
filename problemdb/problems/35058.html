<h1>Problem ID 35058</h1>
<p>
10 magazines lie on a coffee table, completely covering it. Prove that you can remove five of them so that the remaining magazines will cover at least half of the table.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>

Compare the problem to the case where the magazines do not overlap.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>

Let’s number the magazines from 1 to 10. From the second magazine, let’s cut off that part $($if there is one$)$, which is already covered by the first magazine. From the third magazine, let’s cut off the part that is already covered by the first and second magazines. We continue in this way and in the end, from the tenth magazine, let’s cut off the part that is already covered by all of the magazines from the first to the ninth. After the described procedure, 10 magazines $($some of them may have some part cut off and it could be the case that an entire magazine has been removed$)$ will cover the table in one layer. Consequently, 5 magazines, that are the largest by area, cover at least half of the table. It is clear that the same 5 magazines covered at least half of the table area before we cut them. Therefore, the remaining 5 magazines can be removed from the table so that the condition is met.
