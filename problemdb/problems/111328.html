<h1>Problem</h1>
A cinema contains 7 rows of 10 seats each. A group of 50 children went to see the morning screening, and then the evening screening. Prove that there will be two children, who sat in the same row for the morning screening, and also sat in the same row in the evening screening.

<h1>Solution</h1>
If each row had no more than 7 children sitting in it, then the total number of children could be no more than 49. It follows, that there is a row which contained no fewer than 8 children at the morning screening. Since there are only 7 rows, at least two of these children must have ended up in the same row in the evening screening (by the pigeon hole principle).
