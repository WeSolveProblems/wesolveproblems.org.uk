<h1>Problem ID 111328</h1>
<p>
  A cinema contains 7 rows each with 10 seats. A group of 50 children went to see the morning screening of a film, and returned for the evening screening. Prove that there will be two children who sat in the same row for both the morning and the evening screening.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If each row had no more than 7 children sitting in it then the total number of children could be no more than 49. It follows that there is a row which contained no fewer than 8 children at the morning screening. Since there are only 7 rows at least two of these children must have ended up in the same row in the evening screening - by the pigeon hole principle.
