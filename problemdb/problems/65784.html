<h1>Problem ID 65784</h1>
<p>
One day in autumn the Scattered Scientist glanced at his ancient wall clock and saw that three flies fell asleep on the dial. The first one slept exactly at the 12 o'clock mark on the clock, and the other two just as neatly settled on the marks of 2 hours and 5 hours. The scientist made measurements and determined that the hour hand does not threaten the flies, but the minute one will sweep them all in turn. Find the probability that exactly 40 minutes after the Scientist noticed the flies, exactly two flies out of three were swept away by the minute hand.

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
We will call the flies - fly 2, fly 5 and fly 12 with respect to the place where they fell asleep. The arrow could sweep fly 12 and fly 2, but not touch fly 5, only if at the time of the first observation it was located in the interval of 6 to 9 hours, which makes up a 1/4 of the circle. The minute hand could sweep only fly 2 and fly 5, if only at the time of the first observation, it was located between 12 and 2 hours. This makes up a 1/6 of a circle. Finally, the arrow could sweep away only flies 5 and 12 in the event that at first it was located between 4 and 5 o'clock, that is, on an interval occupying 1/12 of a circle. Thus, considering all the initial positions of the arrow to be equally possible and taking into account the uniformity of its motion, we find that the required probability is 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/2.
