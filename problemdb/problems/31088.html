<h1>Problem ID 31088</h1>
<p>
In a country, each two cities are connected with a one-way road.
Prove that there is a city from which you can drive to any other whilst travelling along no more than two roads.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
This is the city from which the largest number of roads come out.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Consider the city A, from which the largest number of roads come out, and an arbitrary city B. If there is a road  which leads from A to B, then everything is in order. If the road leads from B to A, then since B has no more roads coming out of it than A does, then there is a city C, into which the road from A leads, but to which the road from B does not lead. Then you can get from A to B along the route ACB.
