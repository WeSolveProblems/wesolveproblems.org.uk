<h1>Problem ID 111925</h1>
<p>
Author: A.I. Galochkin
<p>
On the plane coordinate axes with the same but not stated scale and the graph of the function y = sin x, x $($0; α$)$ are given.

How can you construct a tangent to this graph at a given point using a compass and a ruler if: a) $α \in (π/2; π)$; b) $α \in (0; π/2)$?


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The tangent to the graph of the function y = sin x, where $x \in (0; α)$, drawn at its given point $(x_0, sin x_0)$, has an angular coefficient, i.e. the tangent of the angle of inclination to the Ox axis is equal to $cos x_0$, and to construct it using a compass and a ruler it is sufficient to construct a segment of length 1. Indeed, having segments 1 and $sin x_0$, we can construct a segment $cos x_0$ $($using the trigonometric circle$)$, and hence an angle whose tangent is $cos x_0$. We show how to construct a segment of length 1 $($that is, to reconstruct the scale$)$.

a)	From point $A = (a, sin a)$, where $a \in (π/22, α)$, lying on the graph of the function, we drop the perpendicular to the Oy axis $(see figure 1)$. Since $sin (π-a) = sin a$, this perpendicular intersects the graph of the function y = sin x at the point $B = (π-a, sin a)$. Through the middle of the segment AB we draw a straight line perpendicular to the Ox axis. It crosses the graph at point $(π/2, 1)$. The segment of this line from the Ox axis to the graph of the function y = sin x has a length of 1.

b)	Here it is somewhat more difficult to construct a segment of unit length. The rest of the constructions will be the same.
<p>
Let a and b be arbitrary points on the Ox axis that satisfy the condition 0 $<$ b $<$ a $<$ α. We construct an interval AB of length sin a + sin b. Through point B we draw a ray l, perpendicular to the segment AB. A circle centred at point A and that has a radius of $2 sin \frac{a+b}{2}$ intersects the ray l at point C (see figure 2). Since $sin a + sin b = 2 sin\frac{a+b}{2}  cos \frac{a-b}{2}$, then $\angle CAB = \frac{a-b}{2}$. On the segment BC we mark the point D such that $BD = sin \frac{a-b}{2}$. Through point D we can draw a straight line parallel to the segment AB. This straight line will cross the segment AC at the point E. The length of the segment AE is 1, since $sin \angle CAB = sin \frac{a-b}{2} = \frac{BD}{AE}$.
