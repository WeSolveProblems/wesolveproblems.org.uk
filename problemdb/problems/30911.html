<h1>Problem ID 30911</h1>
<p>
Will the entire population of the Earth, all buildings and structures on it, fit into a cube with a side length of 3 kilometres?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The volume of such a cube is $27 \times 10^9$ $m^3$. The population of the Earth exceeds $7 \times 10^9$ people. Therefore, each person has less than 4 $m^3$. It can be assumed that there are more buildings per person.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
It will not fit.
