<h1>Problem ID 98363</h1>
<p>
Initially, on each cell of a 1 Ã— n board a checker is placed. The first move allows you to move any checker onto an adjacent cell $($one of the two, if the checker is not on the edge$)$, so that a column of two pieces is formed. Then one can move each column in any direction by as many cells as there are checkers in it $($within the board$)$; if the column is on a non-empty cell, it is placed on a column standing there and unites with it. Prove that for the n - 1 move you can collect all of the checkers on one square.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We choose the central checker (one of the two if n is even). Every next turn we will move that column, in which this checker is located, towards the most remote edge of the board. $($If n is odd, then the first move can be done in any direction$)$. After each move, the number of checkers in the column that we move increases by 1. This means that after the (n-1)th move it will have 1 + (n - 1) = n checkers.
