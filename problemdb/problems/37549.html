<h1>Problem</h1>
Prove that no straight line can cross all three sides of a triangle (at points away from the vertices)

<h1>Solution</h1>
The straight line divides the plane on which the triangle lies into two half-planes. By the pigeon hole principle there will be two vertices that lie in the same half-plane (on the same side of the striaght line). The side connecting these two vertices is not crossed by the straight line.
