<h1>Problem ID 115449</h1>
<p>
  What is the smallest number of 'L' shaped 'corners' out of 3 squares that can be marked on an 8x8 square grid, so that no more 'corners' would fit?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  In any given 2x2 square on the grid, at least two squares must be occupied by a 'corner', otherwise an extra corner would fit on that square.
</p>
<p>
  An 8x8 grid can be divided into 16 2x2 squares, meaning at least 32 grid squares must be occupied by 'corners', which would require no fewer than 11 corners.
</p>
<p>
  One such possible arrangement is shown below.
