<h1>Problem ID 65272</h1>
<p>
Three tired cowboys went into a bar, and hung their hats on the buffalo horn at the entrance. When the cowboys left at night, they were unable to distinguish one hat from another and therefore took the three hats at random. Find the likelihood that none of them took their own hat.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
The cowboys have 6 different possible ways to take their hats. However, in only two out of six variants, no cowboy will take his own hat, since the cowboy who takes the hat first can take any of the other hats of the other cowboys. The remaining cowboys have no choice, since one of their hats has not yet been taken by anybody, then that cowboy must take a different hat.
Thus, the required probability is 2/6 = 1/3.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
1/3.
