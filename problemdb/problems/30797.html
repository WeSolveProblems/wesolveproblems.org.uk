<h1>Problem ID 30797</h1>
<p>
Prove that for a flat graph the inequality 2E $â‰¥$ 3F is valid.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Each piece is limited to no less than three edges.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We put two points onto each edge: one in each of the adjacent pieces. In each piece there are at least three points, so in there are no fewer than 3F points. On the other hand, there are exactly 2E points.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
Of course, we only consider graphs in which two vertices are joined by at most one edge.
