<h1>Problem ID 60607</h1>
<p>
Prove that for any infinite continued fraction [$a_0$; $a_1$, ..., $a_n$, ...] there exists a limit of its suitable fractions - an irrational number α. Explain why if this number α is decomposed into an infinite continued fraction by the algorithm of task 60606, then an infinite continued fraction is obtained.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Appropriate fractions $P_k$ / $Q_k$ to the indicated infinite continued fraction are simultaneously suitable fractions to finite continued fractions of the form
[$a_0$; $a_1$, ..., $a_n$] for n $>$ k. Therefore, the conditions of problem 60602 are fulfilled for them. The existence of the limit α follows from parts b$)$ and d$)$ of this problem. It remains to verify that $a_k$ = [$α_k$] when expanding according to the algorithm from problem number 60606.
