<h1>Problem ID 65270</h1>
<p>
There are fewer than 30 people in a class. The probability that at random a selected girl is an excellent student is 3/13, and the probability that at random a chosen boy is an excellent pupil is 4/11. How many excellent students are there in the class?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
The probability that at random a selected girl is an excellent student is equal to the ratio of the number of excellent female students to the total number of girls in the class. Consequently, the number of girls is divisible by 13, that is, equals 13 or 26. Likewise, the number of boys is either 11 or 22. Considering that there are fewer than 30 people in the class, we find that there are 13 girls $($3 excellent pupils$)$ and 11 boys $($4 excellent pupils$)$ in the class.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
7 excellent students.
