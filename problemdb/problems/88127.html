<h1>Problem ID 88127</h1>
<p>
From a set of weights with masses 1, 2, ..., 101g, a weight of 19 grams was lost. Can the remaining 100 weights be divided into two piles of 50 weights each in such a way that the masses of both piles are the same?

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Try to start by putting weights of 101g and 1g in the first pile, and in the second, the weights of mass of 100g and 2g.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
We put two weights of mass 101g and 1g in the first pile, and weights of mass 100g and 2g in the second pile; then onto the first pile we place the two weights - 99g and 3g, and onto the second - 98g and 4g. We will do this until we put the weights of mass 84g and 18g onto the second pile. At this point, there will be 18 weights in each pile. Now onto the first pile, letâ€™s put the two weights of mass 83g and 20g, and onto the second the two weights of mass 82g and 21g. So, we will continue in this way until we have to put the last pair of weights of 51g and 52g onto the second pile.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
Yes.
