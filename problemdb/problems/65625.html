<h1>Problem ID 65625</h1>
<p>
On the left bank of the river, there were 5 physicists and 5 chemists. All of them need to cross to the right bank. There is a two-seater boat. On the right bank at any time there can not be exactly three chemists or exactly three physicists. How do they all cross over by making 9 trips to the right side?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
At first there are 5 physicists and 5 chemists on the left bank. For the next trip, there and back, 2 chemists leave for the right bank and one chemist returns back to the left bank leaving one chemist on the right bank. For the second trip 2 physicists leave to the right bank and one physicist returns back to the left bank. Therefore currently on the right bank 1 physicist and 1 chemist remains. After the 3rd round trip in which 1 physicist and 1 chemist travel to the right bank, 1 physicist travels back to the left bank leaving 1 physicist and 2 chemists on the right bank. Now currently there are 4 physicists and 3 chemists on the left bank. For the 4th trip there are 5 physicists on the left bank and one chemist, as 2 chemists travel to the right bank and one physicist returns thereby leaving 4 chemists on the right bank. Next 1 physicist and 1 chemist travel to the right bank from the left bank, and for the way back one physicist returns. Next 2 physicists travel from the left bank to the right and one chemist returns so that after the 6th trip 3 physicists and 1 chemist are currently on the left bank and 2 physicists and 4 chemists are on the right bank. For the 7th trip 1 physicist and 1 chemist travels to the right bank and 1 physicist travels back so that 2 physicists and 5 chemists are left on the right bank and 3 physicists are on the left bank. For the 8th trip 2 physicists travel to the right bank and 1 chemist travels back leaving 1 physicist and 1 chemist on the left bank and 4 physicists and 4 chemists on the right bank. Finally the remaining one physicist and one chemist travel from the left bank to the right bank so that all of the academics are situated on the right bank.
