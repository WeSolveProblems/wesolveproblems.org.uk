<h1>Problem ID 64315</h1>
<p>
Author: I.V. Izmestyev
<p>
Postman Pat did not want to give away the parcel. So, Matt suggested that he play the following game: every move, Pat writes in a line from left to right the letters M and P, randomly alternating them, until he has a line made up of 11 letters. Matt, after each of Patâ€™s moves, if he wants, swaps any two letters. If in the end it turns out that the recorded word is a palindrome $($that is, it is the same if read from left to right and right to left$)$, then Pat gives Matt the parcel. Can Matt play in such a way as to get the parcel?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
See the answer to problem number 98434.
<p>
Matt, for example, can act like this. Up to the 5th letter, he does not do anything. When Pat writes the 6th letter, Matt compares it with the 4th $($symmetrical relative to the 5th letter$).$ If these letters are the same, Matt changes their places. If the 4th and 6th letters are different, then one of them does not coincide with the 5th letter. Then the second changes this letter to be different from the fifth one.
<p>
   In any case, after the second move, the 6th letter coincides with the 4th. Similarly, Matt acts further, achieving the desired outcome. 

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, he can.
