<h1>Problem ID 65437</h1>
<p>
Monica is in a broken space buggy at a distance of 18 km from the Lunar base, in which Rachel sits. There is a stable radio communication system between them. The air reserve in the space buggy is enough for 3 hours, in addition, Monica has an air cylinder for the spacesuit, with an air reserve of 1 hour. Rachel has a lot of cylinders with an air supply of 2 hours each. Rachel can not carry more than two cylinders at the same time $($ one of them she uses herself $)$. The speed of movement on the Moon in the suit is 6 km / h. Could Rachel save Monica and not die herself?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Rachel, carrying two cylinders, walks towards the space buggy. After 6 km, she leaves a full tank, and comes back with one $($ it's exactly 2 hours $)$. When at the base, she immediately takes two more cylinders and again walks towards the space buggy. At a distance of 6 km, she takes the left full tank and leaves a half full one. At this moment $($ just 3 hours passes and the air in the space buggy has run out $)$, Monica comes out to meet her with a single cylinder. An hour later they meet at a distance of 6 km from the space buggy and 12 km from the base. Rachel gives Monica a full cylinder that will allow her to reach the base, and she goes with a half full cylinder to the other half cylinder that she left, which she needs to just reach the base.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes she will be able to.
