<h1>Problem ID 35669</h1>
<p>
The rook stands on the square a1 of a chessboard. For a move, you can move it by any number of cells to the right or up. The one who puts the rook on the h8 square will win. Who wins with the right strategy?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Each move the second player can return the rook to the diagonal a1-h8.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We describe the winning strategy of the second player. With his first move, the first player is obliged to remove the rook from the diagonal a1-h8. With his turn, the second player can return the rook to the diagonal. We arrive at a situation similar to the initial one. The only difference is that the rook was closer to the h8 square. Adhering to this strategy, the second player will first come to the h8 cell.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
the second player wins.
