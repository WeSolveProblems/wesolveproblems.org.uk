<h1>Problem ID 78650</h1>
<p>
The number 4 has the property that when it is divided by $q^2$ the remainder is smaller than $q^2$ / 2, whatever the value of q. List all numbers that have this property.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We first prove that if n is a natural number different from 1 and 4, then n $<$ [$\sqrt{2}]^2$. Indeed, for the numbers n $≤$ 7 this assertion is easily verified, and if n $≥$ 8, then $n^2$ $≥$ 8n, therefore n $≥$ 2 $\sqrt{2}$, and hence [$\sqrt{2}]^2$ $≥$ $(\sqrt{2} - 1)^2$ = 2n – 2 $\sqrt{2}$ + 1 $>$ n.
Let n be a natural number different from 1 and 4. Denote q as equal to [$\sqrt{2}$]. Then n $<$ $q^2$, so the remainder from dividing n by $q^2$ is equal to n. But q = [$\sqrt{2n}$] $≤$ $\sqrt{2n}$, therefore
$n^2$ $≥$ q / 2.
