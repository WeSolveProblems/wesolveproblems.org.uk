<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  a) Prove that in any football team there are two players who were born on the same day of the week.
</p>
<p>
  b) Prove that in the population of London, which is almost 9 million, there will be ten thousand people who celebrate their birthday on the same day.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  a) Picture the football players as pigeons, and the days of the week as roosting holes. We have 7 roosting holes in which we need to place 11 pigeons. Using the Pigeon Hole Principle, there will be at least one hole containing at least two pigeons.
</p>
<p>
  b) Consider that on each of the 366 days of the year - including leap years - fewer than 10,000 Londoners are born. This would imply that in the entirety of London there are no more than $366 \times 9 999 = 3 659 634$ people living in London, which as the actual population of London is almost 9 Million must be false.
