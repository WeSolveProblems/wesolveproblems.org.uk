<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  a) Prove that in any football team, there are two players who were born on the same day of the week.
</p>
<p>
  b) Prove, that in the population of London, there will be ten thousand people who celebrate their birthday on the same day.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  a) Picture the football players as rabbits, and the days of the week as hutches. We get 7 hutches, in which we need to place 11 rabbits. By the Pigeon Hole Principle, there will be at least one cage containing at least two rabbits.
</p>
<p>
  b) Consider that on each of the 366 days of the year (including leap years) fewer than 10 000 Londoners are born. This would imply that in the entirety of London there are no more than $366 \times 9 999 = 3 659 634$ people living in London, which is of course false (the actual population of London is almost 9 Million)
