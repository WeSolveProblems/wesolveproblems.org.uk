<h1>Problem 108181</h1>
<p>
  Prove that in any convex polygon there will be no more than 35 vertices with an angle of less than $170^\circ$
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consier that this is not true. There must be some convex $n$-sided polygon which have no fewer than 36 vertices with an angle of less than $170^\circ$. The remaining $n-36$ vertices do not exceed $180^\circ$. The sum of all the angles inside a convex $n$-sided polygon is equal to $ 180^\circ (n-2)$.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore:
</p>
<p>
  $ 180^\circ (n-2) < 170^\circ \times 36 + 180^\circ (n-36) $
</p>

<p>
  That is: $180 \times 34 < 170 \times 36$, or $6120 < 6120$, which is impossible.
