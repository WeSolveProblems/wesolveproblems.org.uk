<h1>Problem</h1>
Prove that in any convex polygon, there will be no more than 35 vertices, with an angle of less than $170^\circ$

<h1>Solution</h1>
Consier that this is not true. There must be some convex $n$-sided polygon which has no fewer than 36 vertices that have an angle of less than $170^\circ$ (the remaining $n-36$ vertices do not exceed $180^\circ$). The sum of all the angles inside a convex $n$-sided polygon is equal to $ 180^\circ (n-2).
Therefore,
$$ 180^\circ (n-2) < 170^\circ \times 36 + 180^\circ (n-36) $$

That is, $180 \times 34 < 170 \times 36$, or $6120 < 6120$, which is impossible.
