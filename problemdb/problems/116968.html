<h1>Problem ID 116968</h1>
<p>
Author: I.V. Raskin
<p>
Some inhabitants of the Island of Multi-coloured Frogs speak only the truth, and the rest always lie. Three islanders said:
<p>
   Bree: There are no blue frogs on our island.
<p>
   Kevin: Bree is a liar. She herself is a blue frog!
<p>
   Clara: Of course, Bree is a liar. But sheâ€™s a red frog.
<p>
Are there any blue frogs on this island?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Kevin and Clara, speaking of the colour of Bree, contradict each other, then at least one of them is a liar. Therefore, the saying "Bree is a liar" is incorrect. So, she told the truth.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
No, there are not.
