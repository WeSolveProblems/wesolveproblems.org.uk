<h1>Problem ID 88167</h1>
<p>
In a cup, glass, jug and jar there is milk, lemonade, cola and water. It is known that the water and the milk are not in the cup; the container with the lemonade stands between the jug and the cola container; the jar does not contain lemonade or water; the glass stands near the jar and the container with milk. Which container is filled with each of the liquids?

<h1>Hint</h1>
What is in the jar? And in the cup?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The jar can only contain cola because the condition implies that it does not have lemonade, water or milk. The cup contains lemonade, as it is known that there is no milk, no water and no cola in it. Since there is no milk, no cola or any lemonade in the glass, this means that it contains water, and the jug contains the liquid that remains, i.e. milk.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
Answer
In the cup - lemonade, in the glass - water, in the jug - milk, in the jar - cola.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
When trying to arrange the containers according to the condition, a problem may arise: it seems that as the glass stands near the jug and the jar, and the cup also stands between the jug and the jar, this arrangement is impossible. However, no one described where everything is actually located. For example, the containers can be arranged in a circle, and then everything corresponds to the condition.
