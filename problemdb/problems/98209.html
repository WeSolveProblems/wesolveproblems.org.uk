<h1>Problem ID 98209</h1>
<p>
A student did not notice the multiplication sign between two three-digit numbers and wrote one six-digit number. The result was three times greater.
Find these numbers.
  
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let A be the first three-digit number, B the second. By the condition 1000A + B = 3AB, whence $(3A - 1)$B = 1000A. The numbers A and 3A - 1 are relatively prime, hence 1000 is divisible by 3A - 1. But A is a three-digit number, hence 3A - 1 is either a three-digit or four-digit number. There are 2 divisors of 1000 of this kind which are 500 and 1000. 3A - 1 can not equal 1000, since 1001 is not divisible by 3. So, 3A - 1 = 500, whence A = 167, B = 334.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
167 and 334.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
3 points.
Compare with the tasks 107749 and 107760.
