<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  A gang contains 50 bandits. The whole gang has never taken part in a raid together, but every possible pair of bandits has taken part in a raid together exactly once. Prove that one of the bandits has taken part in no less than 8 different raids.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Prove that in one of the raids $P$ no fewer than 8 bandits took part. Each bandit who didn't take part in this raid must encounter each one of the bandits who did, in a separate raid.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Assume the opposite is true. Let there be a bandit $A$ who has taken part in no more than 7 raids, and each of the other bandits took part in one of these raids. There are a total of 49 other bandits, therefore at least one of those raids (let us call it raid $P$) involved at least 7 other bandits (excluding $A$). Therefore in total there were no fewer than 8 participants in this raid.  Consider bandit $B$ who did not take part in $P$. $B$ took part in raids with all (at least) 8 participants of $P$, and furthermore with each one separately. Therefore $B$ must have taken part in 8 or more raids.
