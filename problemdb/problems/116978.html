<h1>Problem</h1>
When cleaning her children's room in preparation for the arrival of houseguests, a mother found 9 socks. In a group of any 4 of the socks, at least two belonged to the same child. In a group of any 5 of the socks no more than 3 had the same owner. How many children are there and how many socks belong to each child?

<h1>Solution</h1>
Since in any group of 4 socks at least two belong to the same child, there can be no more than 3 children. None of the children can own more than 3 of the socks (otherwise it would be possible for more than 3 socks to belong to the same owner in a group of 5 socks).
In total, the mother found 9 socks, so there can be no fewer than 3 children. Therefore three children live in the room and each child owns exactly three socks.

<h1>Answer</h1>
Three children, each of whom owns exactly three socks.
