<h1>Problem ID 104078</h1>
<p>
In a burrow there is a family of 24 mice. Every night exactly four of them are sent to the warehouse for cheese.
Could it occur that at some point in time each mouse went to the warehouse with every other mouse exactly one time?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Each mouse in one night can visit the warehouse with three other mice. To visit the warehouse with each of the 23 other mice one time, she needs 23/ 3 nights. But the number 23 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, such a situation is impossible.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
No, it cannot.
