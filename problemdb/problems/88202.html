<h1>Problem ID 88202</h1>
<p>
How can we divide 24kg of nails into two parts of 9kg and 15kg with the help of scales without weights?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Try to weigh 12kg first, then 6kg, then 3kg.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
We take 12kg of nails and set them aside. From the remaining 12kg we weigh 6kg and put them in another pile. From the remaining 6kg we weigh 3kg and combine them with the 6kg pile. We get the desired 9kg of nails.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
We weigh 12kg; from them we weigh 6kg and set aside; from the remaining 6kg we weigh 3kg and combine them with the 6kg that we have previously set aside.
