<h1>Problem ID 111241</h1>
<p>
A New Year's garland, hanging along the school corridor, consists of red and blue light bulbs. Next to each red light bulb there must necessarily be a blue one. What is the largest number of red light bulbs in this garland, if it consists of only 50 light bulbs?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let's calculate what the smallest number of blue light bulbs there can be in the garland. We can assume that the first light bulb is red. Since next to each red light bulb is a blue one, then three red light bulbs can not go in a row. Consequently, at least one light bulb must be blue among every three successive bulbs. Then among the first 48 bulbs there will be no fewer than 48/ 3 = 16 blue light bulbs. The lightbulbs with numbers 49 and 50 can not both be red. So, there should be at least 17 blue bulbs in the garland. Such a case is possible: if the bulbs with the numbers 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., 50 are blue, and the rest are red, then in the garland there are 33 red light bulbs.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
33 light bulbs.
