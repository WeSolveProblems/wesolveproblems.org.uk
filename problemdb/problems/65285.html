<h1>Problem ID 65285</h1>
<p>
Gabby and Joe cut rectangles out of checkered paper. Joe is lazy; He throws a die once and cuts out a square whose side is equal to the number of points that are on the upwards facing side of the die. Gabby throws the die twice and cuts out a rectangle with the length and width equal to the numbers which come out from the die. Who has the mathematical expectation of the rectangle of a greater area?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Let A and B be independent random variables taking the values 1, 2, ..., 6 with equal probabilities. Then the mathematical expectation of the area of the rectangle of Gabby is EAB = $EA \times EB$ = $(EA$)^2$ $($since A and B are independent$)$. The expectation of the area of Joe’s rectangle $EA^2$.
Since 0 $<$ DA = $EA^2 - (EA)^2$, then $EA^2$ $>$ $(EA)^2$.
This means that, on average, the area of the Joe’s square is larger than the area of Gabby’s rectangle.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Joe
</p>
 
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
One could refer to the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the mean quadratic, and also honestly by calculating $EA^2$ and $(EA)^2$.
