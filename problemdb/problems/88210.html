<h1>Problem ID 88210</h1>
<p>
Five first-graders stood in line and held 37 flags. Everyone to the right of Harley has 14 flags, to the right of Dennis – 32 flags, to the right of Vera – 20 flags and to the right of Maxim – 8 flags. How many flags does Sasha have?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Notice, the more flags there are to the right of the first-grader, the more his place is "to the left" in the line.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Obviously, the more flags there are to the right of the first-grader, the more his place is "to the left" in the line. Someone stands to the right of Maxim as otherwise there would be no flags to the right of him. But all except Sasha for sure stand to the left of Maxim. So, to the right of Maxim stands Sasha and holds 8 flags.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
8 flags.
