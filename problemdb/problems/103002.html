<h1>Problem ID 103002</h1>
<p>
In a room there are 85 balloons - red and blue ones. It is known that: 1$)$ at least one of the balls is red, 2$)$ from each arbitrarily chosen pair of balls at least one is blue. How many red balls are there in the room?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>

Think about whether there can be two red balls in the room.
</p>
