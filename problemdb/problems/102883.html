<h1>Problem ID 102883</h1> <p>
On an 8 × 8 chessboard the largest possible number of bishops is placed so that no two bishops threaten each other. Prove that the number of all such constellations is an exact square.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Let the maximum number of bishops than can be placed on white cells be k and this can be done in n ways. This does not interfere with the location of bishops on black cells. Since the set of black cells is obtained from the set of white ones by a 90° turn, you can place as many bishops in the same number of ways. Consequently, there are $n^2$ "maximal" arrangements.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
