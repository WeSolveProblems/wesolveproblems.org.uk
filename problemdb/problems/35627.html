<h1>Problem ID 35627</h1>
<p>
A hostess bakes a cake for some guests. Either 10 or 11 people can come to her house. What is the smallest number of pieces she needs to cut the cake into $($in advance$)$ so that it can be divided equally between 10 and 11 guests?
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
If 10 guests come, then everyone should get at least two pieces.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If 10 guests come, then everyone should get at least two pieces. Otherwise one of the 10 guests would get one piece which is 1/10 of the cake, and if 11 guests come, then this piece would have to be divided further. Thus, the number of pieces is not less than $2 \times 10$ = 20. We will show twenty pieces are enough. Letâ€™s cut the cake into 10 pieces of 1/11 of the cake and 10 pieces of 1/110 of the cake. If 10 guests come, then we will give each one a large piece and one small piece - 1/11 + 1/110 = 1/10. If 11 guests come, then ten of them will be given one big piece $($1/11 of the cake$)$, and one guest will get 10 small pieces.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>

20 pieces.
