<h1>Problem ID 57211</h1>
<p>
Construct a triangle with the side c, median to side a, $m_a$, and median to side b, $m_b$.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose that the triangle ABC is constructed. Let M be the point of intersection of medians $AA_1$ and $BB_1$. Then AM = $2m_a$ / 3 and BM = $2m_b$ / 3. The triangle ABM can be constructed along the lengths of the sides AB = c, AM and BM. Then, on the rays AM and BM, we mark the segments $AA_1$ = $m_a$ and $BB_14 = $m_b4. The vertex C is the point of intersection of the lines $AB_1$ and $A_1B$.
