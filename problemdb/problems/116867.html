<h1>Problem ID 116867</h1>
<p>
Ladybirds gathered in a clearing. If the ladybug has on its back 6 spots, then it always speaks the truth, and if it has 4 spots then it always lies, and there are no other types of ladybirds in the meadow. The first ladybug said: "We each have the same number of spots on our backs." The second one said: "Everyone has 30 spots on their backs in total." "No, they all have 26 spots on their backs in total," the third objected. "Of these three, exactly one told the truth," - said each of the other ladybirds. How many ladybirds were gathered in the meadow?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
If the first ladybug told the truth, then the second and third should also have spoken the truth, since they should have as many points on their backs as the first. But the second and third statements contradict each other, so at least one of them is lying. Therefore, the first ladybug is also lying.  
Let each of the first three ladybirds lie, then all the rest also lied, since none of these three told the truth. So all the ladybugs are liars. But in this case, the first ladybug still told the truth, which can not be the case. Therefore, the first three bugs can not all lie at the same time, so either the second or the third told the truth, and the other two were the liars. Thus, each of the other ladybirds told the truth.
Consequently, there are two ladybugs with 4 spots on their backs and a few ladybirds with six dots on their backs and a total of either 26 or 30 dots on the backs of all the ladybirds. But 30 - $2 \times 4$ = 22, which is not divisible by 6, so there are 26 spots in total, and there were $(26 - 2 \times 4)$ /6 = 3 four spot ladybirds. So, 5 ladybirds were gathered in the clearing.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
5 ladybirds
