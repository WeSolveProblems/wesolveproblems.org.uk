<h1>Problem ID 79293</h1>
<p>
A conference was attended by a group of scientists, some of whom in this group were friends. It turned out that every two of them, having an equal number of friends at the conference, do not have friends in common. Prove that there is a scientist who has exactly one friend among the conference attendees.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let’s take scientist A, who has the maximum number friends $($if there are several such scientists, let’s take any of them$)$; we denote this number of friends by N. Each of the N friends of scientist A has at least one friend $($A$)$, has no more than N friends, and no two have an equal number of friends. Consequently, these people have 1, 2, 3, ..., N friends. In particular, one of them is only friends with A.
