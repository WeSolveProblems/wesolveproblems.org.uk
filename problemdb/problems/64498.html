<h1>Problem ID 64498</h1>
<p>
Of five coins, two are fake. One of the counterfeit coins is lighter than the real one, and the other is heavier than the real one by as much as the lighter one is lighter than the real coin. <p>

Explain how in the three weighings, you can find both fake coins using scales without weights.

</p><h1>Solution 1</h1><p>
  We will put aside one coin, and on each side of the scales we will put two coins. There are two possible cases. <p>

  1) The scales are in equilibrium. Since we do not have four real coins, then both counterfeit coins lie on one side. For the next weighing, it is enough to compare the weights of the coins from one side of the scales: if the scales are in equilibrium, then these coins are real, and the counterfeit coins are on the other side of the scales; if the scales are not in equilibrium, then the counterfeit coins are on the scales. <p>

3)	The scales are not in equilibrium. Then on the scales there is either only a light fake coin on the lighter side or only a heavy fake coin on the heavier side, or both coins are on different sides. The second weighing will compare the weights of the coins on the lighter side of the scales: if the scales are not in equilibrium, then the lighter coin is fake. If the scales are in equilibrium, then the coin that was earlier put aside is fake $($and it is light$)$. Similarly, by weighing the third we compare the weights of the coins from the heavier side: then, either the heavier coin is false, or, if the scales are in equilibrium, the coin is counterfeit $($and it is heavy$)$.
<p>

</p><h1>Solution 2</h1><p>
  For the first time we put the first and second coins on the scales, and the second time - the third and fourth. Only two cases are possible. <p>

  1) One time the scales were in equilibrium (let it be during the first weighing, while on both sides of the scales there are real coins), and another time - no. <p>

  Take the real coin from the first weighing and compare it with the one that remained on the table. If their weights are equal, then the last coin is real, and the fake ones are those that participated in the second weighing. Otherwise, the coin from the table is fake, and we know whether it is lighter or heavier, and so we know that the light or heavy fake coin participated in the second weighing. <p>

  2) Both times the scales were not in equilibrium. Then on the scales each time there was one false coin, and on the table, there was a real one. We weigh it with a light coin from the first weighing. If the weights are equal, then in the first weighing the counterfeit coin was heavier, and in the second - the lighter one. If the lighter coin from the first weighing was lighter, then it is fake, and from the second weighing, the counterfeit coin is heavier.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
Note that solution 2 does not use the fact that both counterfeit coins weigh as much as two real coins.
