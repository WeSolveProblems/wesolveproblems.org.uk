<h1>Problem ID 65334</h1>
<p>
Valerie wrote the number 1 on the board, and then several more numbers. As soon as Valerie writes the next number, Mike calculates the median of the already available set of numbers and writes it in his notebook. At some point, in Mike’s notebook, the numbers: 1; 2; 3; 2.5; 3; 2.5; 2; 2; 2; 2.5 are written.
<p>
a)	What is the fourth number written on the board?
<p>
  b) What is the eighth number written on the board?

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
a)	The first number is obviously one. Then, in order for the median of the first two numbers to be 2, the second number must be 3.
<p>
  For clarity, we will write Valerie’s numbers. Valerie wrote the third number a: 1 3 $a_3$. The median is now 3, and this can only be if $a \geq 3$. Let’s add the next number: 1 3 $a \geq 3$ b.
<p>
  The median of the set obtained by condition is 2.5. This can only be for b = 2.
<p>
b)	We assign the fifth number and obtain the series 1 2 3 $a \geq 3$ c. The median is 3, which means that $c \geq 3$.
<p>
  Let’s add the sixth number: 1 2 3 $a \geq 3 c \geq 3 d$. The median again decreased to 2.5. Therefore, $d \leq 2$.
<p>
  Let’s add the seventh number e: $1 d \leq 2$ 2 3 $a \geq 3 c \geq 3 e$. Now the median is 2. It is clear that $e \leq 2$, otherwise numbers that are not more than two will become 3, that is, less than half of the total number of numbers. Let’s add the eighth number: $1 d \leq 2 e \leq 2$ 2 3 $a \geq 3 c \geq 3 f $.
<p>
  The median is again 2. Hence $f \leq 2$. In this case, if one of the numbers d, e is 2, then f is any number not greater than 2. If both d and e are less than 2, then f = 2.
<p>
  In any case, a series of the form $1 x \leq 2 y \leq 2$ 2 3 $a \leq 3 c \leq 3$ is obtained. It does not contradict the conditions of the problem: if Valerie writes two more threes, then the ninth median will be 2, and the tenth will be 2.5.

</p> 
<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
a)	2; b) if the sixth or seventh number is 2, then the eighth number is not more than 2; if both the sixth and seventh number is less than 2, then the eighth number is 2. Other options are impossible.
