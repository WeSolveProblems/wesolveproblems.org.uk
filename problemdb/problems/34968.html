<h1>Problem ID 34968</h1>
<p>
Prove that for any number d, which is not divisible by 2 or by 5, there is a number whose decimal notation contains only ones and which is divisible by d.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Some two of the numbers, the decimal record of which contain only ones, have the same remainders when dividing by d.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Consider numbers, the decimal notation of which contain only ones: 1, 11, 111, ... Since there are infinitely many of such numbers, among them there are two numbers that have the same remainder when dividing by d. The difference of these two numbers will have the form A = 1 ... 10 ... 0, that is, it will be written with several ones, followed by zeros; in addition, the number A is divisible by d. By assumption, d and 10 are mutually prime, therefore, the number made up of ones, obtained from A by deleting zeroes, is also divisible by d.
