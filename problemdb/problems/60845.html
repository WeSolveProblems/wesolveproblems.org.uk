<h1>Problem ID 60845</h1>
<p>
Let the number Î± be given by the decimal:
<p>
a$)$ 0.101001000100001000001 ...;
<p>
b$)$ 0.123456789101112131415 ....
<p>
Will this number be rational?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Rational numbers are expressed in periodic decimals. Suppose that our fraction is periodic: some sequence T consisting of n digits is the fraction period beginning with the m-th decimal point. Among the digits after the m-th character there are non-zero ones, therefore in the sequence T of digits there is a non-zero digit. This means that, starting with the m-th digit after the decimal point, there is a non-zero digit among any n digits in a row. However, in the decimal notation of this fraction there should be a decimal notation of the number $10^k$, where k is greater than m and n. This entry will appear to the right of the m-th digit and contains more than n zeros in a row. This gives us a contradiction.

<p>
a-b$)$ It will not.
