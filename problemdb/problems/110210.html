<h1>Problem ID 110210</h1>
<p>
Authors: I.I. Bogdanov, A. Khrabrov
<p>
Prove that for each x such that $sin x \neq 0$, there is a positive integer n such that |sin nx| $\geq \frac{{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Since the sine function is odd and has a period of 2π, we can assume that 0 $<$ x $<$ π.
<p>
If $π/2 \leq x \leq 2π/3$, then n = 1 is fine.
<p>
If 0 $<$ x $<$ π/3, then, sequentially laying off the angles x, 2x, nx, we will get out of the interval $(0; π/3)$ at some point; And since the step π/3 is smaller, we will get into the interval already considered [π/3; 2 π/3].
<p>
If $x \in (2π/3; π)$, then, taking into account the equality $| sin nx | = | sin n (π -x) |$, this case reduces to the case $x \in (0; π/3)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
