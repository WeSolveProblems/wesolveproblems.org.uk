<h1>Problem ID 65328</h1>
<p>
Izzy wrote a correct equality on the board: 35 + 10 - 41 = 42 + 12 - 50, and then subtracted 4 from both parts: 35 + 10 - 45 = 42 + 12 - She noticed that on the left hand side of the equation all of the numbers are divisible by 5, and on the right hand side by 6. Then she took 5 outside of the brackets on the left hand side and 6 on the right hand side and got 5$($7 + 2 – 9)4 = 6$($7 + 2 – 9). Having simplified both sides by a common multiplier, Izzy found that 5 = 6. Where did she go wrong?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
The equality ac = bc for c = 0 is satisfied by any numbers a and b. Izzy’s mistake is that she simplified the equation by 7 + 2 - 9 = 0.
