<h1>Problem ID 116468</h1>
<p>
 Peter recorded an example of an addition on a board, after which he replaced some digits with letters, with the same figures being replaced with the same letters, and different figures with different letters. He did it such that he was left with the sum: CROSS + 2011 = START. Prove that Peter made a mistake.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Note that the number ending in SS, when added to the number ending in 11, in the sum gives a number, in which the last two digits are different. This is possible only if S = 9. Then T = 0 and R = 1. The START number starts with the digit 9, therefore, K = 8. But in the thousands, 1 and 2 are added, so there cannot be a transition over ten.
