<h1>Problem ID 65073</h1>
<p>
In a group of six people, any five can sit down at a round table so that every two neighbours know each other.
Prove that the entire group can be seated at the round table so that every two neighbours will know each other.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Note that, everyone in the group has at least three acquaintances. Indeed, if person X was acquainted with fewer than three people, then excluding one of his acquaintances from the group would mean that we would get five people. In this group, person X would have no more than one acquaintance and therefore, to put them at a round table in compliance with the conditions of the problem would be impossible.

We can now take any five people and put them around the table. The sixth person is acquainted with at least three of the five people and thus he knows a pair of people sitting next to each other. Therefore, it remains to place the sixth person among them.
