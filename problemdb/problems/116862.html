<h1>Problem ID 116862</h1>
<p>
In front of a gnome there lie three piles of diamonds: one with 17, one with 21 and one with 27 diamonds. In one of the piles lies one fake diamond. All the diamonds have the same appearance, and all real diamonds weigh the same, and the fake one differs in its weight. The gnome has a cup weighing scale without weights. The dwarf must find with one weighing a pile, in which all the diamonds are real. How should he do it?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We put all the diamonds from the first pile on one scales, and on the other 17 diamonds from the second $($ or from the third $)$. If the balance is in balance, then in the first pile all the stones are real. If there is no balance, then the pile, whose stones do not participate in the weighing, contains only real diamonds.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
Other solutions are possible.
