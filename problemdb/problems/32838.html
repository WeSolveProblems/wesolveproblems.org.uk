<h1>Problem ID 32838</h1>
<p>
Harry and Matt came down from a mountain. Harry walked on foot, and Matt went skiing, which was seven times faster than Harry. Halfway down, Matt fell, broke his skis and his leg, and hence travelled twice as slow as Harry. Who will descend first from the mountain?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Matt walked on foot from halfway up the mountain for as long as Harry descended from the summit.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Harry.
</p>
 
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
1. In fact, Harry will catch up with Matt and help him, so they will come together.
<p>
2. Compare with the tasks 36043, 36044, 88128.
