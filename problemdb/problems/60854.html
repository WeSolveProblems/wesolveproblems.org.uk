<h1>Problem ID 60854</h1>
<p>
Is it possible for
<p>
a$)$ the sum of two rational numbers irrational?
<p>
b$)$ the sum of two irrational numbers rational?
<p>
c$)$ an irrational number with an irrational degree to be rational?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
a$)$ no.
<p>
b$)$ $\sqrt{2}$ + (- $\sqrt{2}$) = 0.
<p>
c$)$ Define the number $\alpha$ by the equality $(\sqrt{3})^α$ = 2. If $\alpha$ = p/q, then we obtain the impossible equality 3p = 4q.
<p>
Another example can be constructed using the number $\beta$ = $√2^√2$. If it is rational, then the problem is solved. If it is irrational, then $\beta^{\sqrt2}$ = 2 and the required pair of numbers is $\beta and $\sqrt{2}$
