<h1>Problem</h1>
Is it possible to place the numbers $1, 2,...12$ around a circle, so that the difference between any two adjacent numbers was 3, 4, or 5?

<h1>Solution</h1>
Notice, that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12 cannot be next to one another. Since there are only 12 positions in total, these numbers have to be placed in every second position - as otherwise by the pigeon hole principle two of the numbers will end up adjacent.
It remains only to notice that the number 4 needs to obey the condition with two of the numbers listed above (as it has to be positioned between them), however it only does so with one - the number 1.

<h1>Answer</h1>
No, it is not.
