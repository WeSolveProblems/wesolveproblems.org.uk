<h1>Problem ID 78629</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to place the numbers $1, 2,...12$ around a circle so that the difference between any two adjacent numbers is 3, 4, or 5?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Notice that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12 cannot be next to one another. Since there are only 12 positions in total, these numbers have to be placed in every second position as otherwise by the pigeon hole principle two of the numbers will end up adjacent. It remains only to notice that the number 4 needs to obey the condition with two of the numbers listed above as it has to be positioned between them, however it only does so with one - the number 1.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
No, it is not.
