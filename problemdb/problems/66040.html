<h1>Problem ID 66040</h1>
<p>
In a shopping centre, three machines sell coffee. During the day, the first machine can break down with a probability of 0.4 and the second with a probability of 0.3. Every evening, Mr Ivanov, the mechanic, comes and repairs all of the broken-down coffee machines. One day, Ivanov wrote, in his report, that the mathematical expectation of breakdowns during one week is 12. Prove that Mr Ivanov is exaggerating.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
The mathematical expectation of the number of breakdowns per day, obviously, does not exceed 0.4 + 0.3 + 1 = 1.7. And for one week: $1.7 \times 7$ = 11.9 $<$ 12.
