<h1>Problem ID 61304</h1>
<p>
Method of iterations. In order to approximately solve an equation, it is allowed to write $f (x) = x$, by using the iteration method. First, some number $x_0$ is chosen, and then the sequence ${x_n}$ is constructed according to the rule $x_{n + 1} = f (x_n) (n \geq 0)$. Prove that if this sequence has the limit x * = $ \lim \limits_ {n \to \infty} x_n$, and the function $f (x)$ is continuous, then this limit is the root of the original equation: $f (x ^*) = x^*$.
