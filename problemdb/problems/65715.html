<h1>Problem ID 65715</h1>
<p>
  A mix of boys and girls are standing in a circle. There are 20 children in total. It is known that each boys' neighbour in the clockwise direction is a child wearing a blue T-shirt, and that each girls' neighbour in the anticlockwise direction is a child wearing a red T-shirt. Is it possible to uniquely determine how many boys there are in the circle?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let $B$ represent a boy and $G$ represent a girl. The arrangement $BXG$ is not possible, due to the conflicting colours of the T-shirt belonging to $X$. Therefore, two children along from a boy in a clockwise direction must be a boy - and two children along from that boy in a clockwise direction must also be a boy, and so on all the way around the circle. This means that boys make up at least half of the total number of children in the circle. Using analogous reasoning for girls, we can show that they also make up at least half the number of children in the circle. It follows, since both boys and girls are present, that there are 10 of each.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  Yes, it is possible.
