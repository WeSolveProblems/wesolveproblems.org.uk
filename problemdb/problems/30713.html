<h1>Problem ID 30713</h1>
<p>
Prove that every number a in Pascal’s triangle is equal to
<p>
a$)$ the sum of the numbers of the previous right diagonal, starting from the leftmost number up until the one to the right above the number a.
<p>
b$)$ the sum of the numbers of the previous left diagonal, starting from the leftmost number to the one to left of the number which is above a.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
a$)$ The number a is equal to the number of paths leading from the vertex O of Pascal’s triangle to the place A, where the number a stands $($ see problem number 30710$)$. Each such path passes through the indicated right diagonal. Suppose that there are the numbers $b_0$, $b_1$, ..., $b_k$ at the points $B_0$, $B_1$, ..., $B_k$ above the point A. The points O and $B_i$ are connected by $b_i$ paths. Each of them can be led to A in only one way: go to the next diagonal and descend along it to the point A. Therefore
a = $b_0$ + $b_1$ + ... + $b_k$.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. You can also get to the solution by induction on the number of numbers on the diagonal.
<p>
2. Point $(b)$ is proved similarly. See also various proofs of the equality d$)$ in Problem number 60413.
