<h1>Problem ID 103967</h1>
<p>
There is a rectangular table. Two players start in turn to place on it one pound coin each, so that these coins do not overlap one another. The player who cannot make a move loses. Who will win with the correct strategy?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let's show how the first player should act in order to win regardless of the actions of the second player. His first move is to put the coin exactly in the middle of the table. After that, for any move of the second player, the first player must make the symmetric move to the second player relative to the center of the table. This move is possible, because after any move of the first player, the arrangement of coins on the table is symmetrical with respect to the center of the table. Hence, if there is a free space for the coin of the second player, then the place that is symmetric to it will also be free.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
With the correct strategy, the first player wins.
