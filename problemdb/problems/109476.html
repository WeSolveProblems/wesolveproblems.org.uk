<h1>Problem ID 109476</h1>
<p>
 Sarah believes that two watermelons are heavier than three melons, Anna believes that three watermelons are heavier than four melons. It is known that one of the girls is right, and the other is mistaken. Is it true that 12 watermelons are heavier than 18 melons? $($It is believed that all watermelons weigh the same and all melons weigh the same.$)$

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Sarah's saying is equivalent to the fact that six watermelons are heavier than nine melons. Anna's - the fact that six watermelons are heavier than eight melons. Therefore, if Sarah is right, then Anna is also. But they both can not be right. So, Anna is right, and Sarah is wrong. That is, six watermelons are heavier than eight melons, but not heavier than nine. Consequently, twelve watermelons are heavier than sixteen melons, but not heavier than eighteen.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
No, it is false.
