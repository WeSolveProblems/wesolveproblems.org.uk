<h1>Problem ID 88252</h1>
<p>
Try to get one billion $($1000000000$)$ by multiplying two whole numbers, in each of which there cannot be a single zero.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to consider the divisors of the number 1,000,000,000.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The divisors of the number 1000000000 will be nine deuces, nine fives and any combinations of their works. But as soon as there are a 5 and a 2 at the same time, the number will end in a 0. This means that the only possible factors are $2^9$ and $5^9$ $($since in all other pairs of divisors there are numbers ending in 0$)$. Checking this shows that both these numbers do not contain zeros. So: 1 000 000 000 = $(2^9 \times 5^9)$ = $(512 $ \ Times $ 1 953 125)$.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
1 000 000 000 = $2^9 \times 5^9$ = $512 \times 1 953 125$.
