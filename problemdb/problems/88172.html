<h1>Problem ID 88172</h1>
<p>
In the equation 101 - 102 = 1, move one digit in such a way that that it becomes true.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
If the number 2 in the number 102 is moved upwards, to the place of the exponent, then the original equality takes the form 101 â€“ $10^2$ = 1 and will be true.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
The number 2 in the number 102 should be put in the place of the exponent.
</p>


<h1>Remarks</h1>
Another solution is possible: if we assume that the numbers are represented in the ternary system, we get the following permutation: 110 - 102 = 1.
