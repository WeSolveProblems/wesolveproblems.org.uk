<h1>Problem ID 111923</h1>
<p>
When water is drained from a pool, the water level h in it varies depending on the time t according to the function
h $($t$)$ = at^2 + bt + c, and at the time t_0 of when the draining is ending, the equalities h $($t_0$)$ = h' $($t_0$)$ = 0 are satisfied. For how many hours does the pool drain completely, if in the first hour the water level in it is reduced by half?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Since h'$($t_0$)$ = 0 and h$($t_0$)$ = 0, then a $\neq$ 0 $($otherwise the function h would be zero, and the water level in the basin, contrary to the condition of the problem, could not decrease$)$, and the abscissa and ordinate of the vertex of the parabola y = h $($t$)$ are equal to $t_0$ and 0, respectively, so
h $($t$)$ = a $($t-t_0$)$^2$, t $\geq$ $t_0$.
<p>
Denoting by T the required time for a complete drain of the pool, from the condition of the problem we have

and, considering that T $>$ 1, we finally get T = 2 +

A comment. It is known from the laws of physics that the function y = h $($t$)$ satisfies the differential equation
y '= -k

, k $>$ 0, which describes the height of the liquid level in a vessel which has an opening in its bottom. The solution of this equation is precisely the quadratic function indicated in the problem $($up to the instant of complete drainage of the liquid$)$.
