<h1>Problem</h1>
A ream of squared paper is shaded in in two colours. Prove that there are two horizontal and two vertical lines, the points of intersection of which are shaded in the same colour.

<h1>Solution</h1>
Consider three horizontal lines and nine vertical lines. Consider only the points of intersection of these lines. Since there are only $2^3=8$ possible variations of colours of the three points in two colours, there will be two horizontal lines on which the same permutation of colours of points of intersection is present. Amongst three points, shaded in two colours, there will be two points of the same colour. The vertical lines which pass through these two points, in combination with the earlier selected two horizontal lines are the lines asked for in the question.
