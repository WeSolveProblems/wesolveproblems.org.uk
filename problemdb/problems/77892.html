<h1>Problem ID 77892</h1>
<p>
There are 13 weights, each weighing an integer number of grams. It is known that any 12 of them can be divided into two cups of weights, six weights on each one, which will come to equilibrium. Prove that all the weights have the same weight.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
See the problem number 61350 $(a)$.

There is a system of equations
<p>
* x + * y + * z = 0,
<p>
* x + * y + * z = 0,
<p>
* x + * y + * z = 0.

Two people alternately enter a number instead of a star.
Prove that the player that goes first can always ensure that the system has a non-zero solution.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Here is one possible strategy. The first player first writes an arbitrary coefficient in front of z in the first equation. Next, if the second player writes some coefficient in front of x or in front of y, then the first writes the same coefficient in the same equation for y or at x. If the second writes some coefficient at z, then the first writes an arbitrary coefficient for z in the remaining equation. The resulting system has a solution $(1, -1, 0)$.
