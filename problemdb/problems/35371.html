<h1>Problem ID 35371</h1>
<p>
  We are given 101 natural numbers whose sum is equal to 200. Prove that we can always pick some of these numbers so that the sum of the picked numbers is 100.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  The following interpretation of the problem may help: a circle of circumference 200, divided into 101 arcs, the lengths of which are equal to the numbers.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let the given numbers be equal to $a_1, a_2,...,a_{101}$. Consider a circle of circumference 200. Mark on this circumference 200 dashes, dividing the circle into 200 arcs of equal length. Mark one of these points. Now, clockwise from the marked point, mark a point at the end of an arc of length $a_1$. From this point, do the same for the arc of length $a_2$, and so on until the end of the arc of length $a_101$.
</p>
<p>
  In this way, on top of the 200 dashes, there will be 101 marked points, that divide the circle into arcs corresponding to the representation of the number 200 in the form of the sum of $a_1, a_2,...,a_101$.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the dashes divide the circle into 100 pairs of diametrically opposite dashes. Since there are 101 marked points, there will always be at least one pair of points marked that are diametrically opposite. The diameter passing through this pair of points divides the arcs of lengths $a_1, a_2,...,a_101$ into two groups. The sum of each of these groups is equal to half the circumference of the circle, or 100. Clearly this gives a group of numbers out of those given from which we can pick to give a sum of 100 - which is what is required.
