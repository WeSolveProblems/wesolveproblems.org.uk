<h1>Problem ID 32792</h1>
<p>
There is a kingdom in which live liars and knights. The liars always lie and the knights always tell the truth. An adventurer is travelling through this kingdom with an official guide and is introduced to a local. "Are you a knight?" asked the adventurer. The local answers "Yrrg," which means either "yes" or "no". The guide, after being asked for a translation, says "He said 'yes'. I will add that he is actully a liar." What do you think?

</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
1) Notice that, from the beginning, the adventurer could have known that "Yrrg" means "yes" even without the help of the guide. In fact, regardless of whether the local is a knight or a liar, he will answer "yes" to the question "are you a knight?". 2) This means that the guide is a knight and tells the truth, so by his word we have that the local is a liar.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
It is true that "Yrrg" means "yes" and that the local is a liar.
