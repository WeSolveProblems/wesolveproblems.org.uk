<h1>Problem ID 104045</h1>
<p>
   a) In how many ways can Dima paint five Christmas trees in silver, green and blue colours, if the amount of paint is unlimited, and he paints each tree in only one colour?
   b) Dima has five baubles: a red, a green, a yellow, a blue and a gold one. In how many ways can he decorate five Christmas trees with them, if he needs to put exactly one bauble on each tree?
   c) What about if he can hang several baubles on one Christmas tree (and all of the baubles have to be used)?
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a)	Each of the five trees can be painted in one of three colours, so there are $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ = $3^5$ different methods.
<p>
   b) Dima can hang any of the five baubles on the first tree, on the second tree - any of the remaining four, and so on; in total, we get $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ = 120 methods.
   c) Each of the baubles can be put on any tree, so in this case the answer is $5^5$.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a)	243; b) 120; c) 3125.
