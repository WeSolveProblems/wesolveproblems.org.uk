<h1>Problem ID 60450</h1>
<p>
Tickets cost 50 cents, and 2n buyers stand in line at a cash register. Half of them have one dollar, the rest - 50 cents. The cashier starts selling tickets without having any money. How many different orders of people can there be in the queue, such that the cashier can always give change?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Putting each buyer with 50 cents in correspondence with a unit, and buyers with a dollar in correspondence with a minus one, we get a sequence that satisfies the conditions of task number 60447.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
$C_n$.
