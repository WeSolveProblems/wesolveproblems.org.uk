<h1>Problem ID 86556</h1>
<p>
<b>A game with three piles of rocks.</b>
There are three piles of rocks: in the first pile there are 10 rocks, 15 in the second pile and 20 in the third pile. In this game &#40;with two players&#41;, in one turn a player is allowed to divide one of the piles into two smaller piles. The loser is the one who cannot make a move. Which player would be the winner?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In total there are 45 rocks. In the end we get 45 piles with 1 rock each. In order to divide the first pile into piles with 1 rock each, we need 9 moves. To do the same for the second pile we need 14 moves, and for the third pile we need 19 moves. &#40;Note: the number of moves does not depend on whether we take one rock out of the pile per move, or a few rocks per move.&#41; Thus the total number of moves is $9+14+19=42$ and this number does not depend on which moves the players make. The last, even, move is by the second player, and so the second player wins.
