<p>
	In the middle column, we write 8 - C = 3, hence C = 5. From the second line, we get E = 0. Now in the first line, we get that AB + 8 = 35, hence A = 2, B = 7. Then, from the first column we get D = 1, and the entire puzzle is decrypted.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
A = 2, B = 7, C = 5, D = 1, E = 0.
