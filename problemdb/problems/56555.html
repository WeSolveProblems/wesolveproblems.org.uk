<h1>Problem ID 56555</h1>
<p>
On a circle, the points A, B, C, D are given in the indicated order. M is the midpoint of the arc AB. We denote the intersection points of the chords MC and MD with the chord AB by E and K. Prove that KECD is an inscribed quadrilateral.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
It is clear that 2$(\angle KEC + \angle KDC)$ = $(\smile MB + \smile AC)$ + $(\smile MB + \smile BC)$ = 360$^{\circ}$, because $\smile MB = \smile AM$.
</p>
