<h1>Problem ID 116936</h1>
<p>
Thirty girls - 13 in red dresses and 17 in blue dresses - led a dance around the Christmas tree. Subsequently, each of them was asked if her neighbour on the right was in a blue dress. It turned out that those girls which answered correctly were only those who stood between two girls in dresses of the same color. How many girls could have said yes?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Consider any girl. The colors of the dresses of her neighbors on the left and on the right could be: blue - blue, blue - red, red - blue, red - red. The girl answers "yes" only in the first two cases; that is exactly in those cases when her neighbor on the left is in a blue dress.
But the neighbor on the left was in a blue dress for exactly 17 girls, so the answer "yes" was said 17 times.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
17 girls.
