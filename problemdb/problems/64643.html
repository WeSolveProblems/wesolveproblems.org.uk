<h1>Problem ID 64643</h1>
<p>
Author: M.A. Khachaturyan<p>

Mum baked identical pies with the same appearance: 7 with cabbage, 7 with meat and one with cherries, and laid them out in a circle on a round dish in this order. Then she put the dish into a microwave and to warm up the pies. Olga knows how she originally arranged the pies, but she does not know the dish turned in the microwave. She wants to eat a pie with cherries, and she thinks that the rest are tasteless. How does Olga surely achieve this, after biting into no more than three tasteless pies?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
See problem number 64573. <p>

It is clear that in one bite Olga cannot cope with the task. If Olga, for example, tasted the pie with cabbage, then she is not able to determine which of the three she got, and therefore cannot with confidence find the pie with cherries. Let's show how Olga will cope with the task in two bites. <p>

  Let Olga bite the pie and suppose that this pie was with cabbage and not with cherries. Then she can try the pie, lying one from the cabbage pie in a clockwise direction. If this is a pie with cherries, then Olga has achieved her goal and if the pie was with meat, then the desired pie is between the bitten ones, and if it is again with cabbage, then we must take the next clockwise pie, and this will definitely be a pie with cherries.
If the first pie is with meat, then Olga can act similarly but move counter-clockwise.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
