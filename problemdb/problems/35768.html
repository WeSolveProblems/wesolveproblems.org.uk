<h1>Problem ID 35768</h1> <p>
Draw six points on the plane so that they serve as vertices for exactly 17 triangles.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
If no three points lie on one line, then every three points will form a triangle, and there will be only $C_6^3 = 20$ triangles. If you "put" three points on one straight line, then one triangle will be smaller. Hence, we need to create three triples of points lying on one line.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
For example, we can take vertices and midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary triangle.
