<h1>Problem ID 104046</h1>
<p>
   A cannibal has 25 prisoners in a cellar:
   <p>
   a) In how many ways can he choose three of them for breakfast, lunch and dinner? Note that the order is important.
   <p>
   b) And how many ways are there to choose three to set free?

</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
   a) For breakfast, the cannibal can choose any of the 25 people, for lunch - any of the remaining 24, and for dinner - one of the remaining 23 people. In total, we get $25 \times 24 \times 23$ = 13 800 ways.
   <p>
   b) Note that in the previous part, each group of three prisoners was counted $3 \times 2 \times 1$ = 6 times. Since now their order is not important to us, the answer is 13800/6 = 2300.


</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a) 13 800 ways; b) 2 300 ways.
