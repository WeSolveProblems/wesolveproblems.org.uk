<h1>Problem ID 116817</h1>
<p>
There is a group of 5 people: Alex, Beatrice, Victor, Gregory and Deborah. Each of them has one of the following codenames: V, W, X, Y, Z. We know that:
<br>
Alex is 1 year older than V,
<br>
Beatrice is 2 years older than W,
<br>
Victor is 3 years older than X,
<br>
Gregory is 4 years older than Y.
<br>
Who is older and by how much: Deborah or Z?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The sum of the ages of Alex, Beatrice, Victor, Gregory and Deborah should be equal to the sum of the ages of V, W, X, Y and Z. This means that Z is older than Deborah by $1+2+3+4=10$ years.
</p>



<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Z is older than Deborah by 10 years.
