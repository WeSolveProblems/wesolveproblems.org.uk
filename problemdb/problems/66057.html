<h1>Problem ID 66057</h1>
<p>
According to one implausible legend, Cauchy and Bunyakovsky were very fond of playing darts in the evenings. But the target was unusual - the sectors on it were unequal, so the probability of getting into different sectors was not the same. Once Cauchy throws a dart and hits the target. Bunyakovsky throws the next one. Which is more likely: that Bunyakovsky will hit the same sector that Cauchy’s dart went into, or that his dart will land on the next sector clockwise?

</p> 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
  Let probabilities of hitting the sectors be equal to $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ $($indices indicate the sector numbers$)$. The probability that Bunyakovsky will hit the same sector as Cauchy is equal to $p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_n^2$
, and the probability that Bunyakovsky will hit the next clockwise sector is equal to $p_1p_2 + p_2p_3 + ... + p_{n-1}p_n + p_np_1$.
<p>
  It obviously follows from the inequality $a^2 + b^2 ≥ 2ab$ that <img src="66057 3.gif">

<p>
 In this case, equality is attained only in the case when $p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_n$, which contradicts the condition.

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
That he will hit the same sector.
