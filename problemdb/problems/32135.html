<h1>Problem ID 32135</h1>
<p>
  101 points are marked on a plane; not all of the points lie on the same straight line. A red pencil is used to draw a straight line passing through each possible pair of points. Prove that there will always be a marked point on the plane through which at least 11 red lines pass.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Choose one of the marked points. If at least 11 straight lines pass through this point then we have proven the statement.
</p>
<p>
  Let there be no more than 10 straight lines passing through this point. Excluding the chosen point, 100 points lie on these lines. By the pigeon hole principle there must be a line $I$ containing at least 10 of these. Therefore including the chosen point, the line $I$ contains at least 11 marked points. Consider now any point not lying on $I$. It is connected with a red line to all of the marked points lying on $I$. Therefore no fewer than 11 red lines pass through it.
