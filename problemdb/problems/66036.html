<h1>Problem ID 66036</h1> <p>
	There is an elastic band and glass beads: four identical red ones, two identical blue ones and two identical green ones. It is necessary to string all eight beads on the elastic band in order to get a bracelet. How many different bracelets can be made so that beads of the same colour are not next to each other? $($Assume that there is no buckle, and the knot on the elastic is invisible$)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
2 bracelets.
