<h1>Problem ID 30448</h1>
<p>
There are two piles of rocks: one with 30 rocks and the other with 20 rocks. In one turn a player is allowed to take any number of rocks but only from one of the piles. The loser is the player who has no rocks left to take. Who would win in a two player game, if the right strategy is used?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first player wins. During their first turn, the first player takes 10 rocks from the first pile. Then the first player uses symmetric strategy. That is, for the following turns the first player takes as many rocks as the second player, but from the other pile. In this way the first player always has rocks left to take.
