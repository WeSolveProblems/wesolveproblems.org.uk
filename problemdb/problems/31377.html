<h1>Problem ID 31377</h1>
<p>
There are two identical gears with 14 teeth on a common shaft. They are aligned and four pairs of teeth are removed.
Prove that the gears can be rotated so that they form a complete gear $($one containing no gaps$)$.
</p>
<h1>Solution </h1>
<p>
Let the teeth $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $A_{3}$, $A_{4}$ be the ones that are removed. We will rotate the upper gear relative to the lower one. In addition to the starting position, there are 13 more positions the upper gear can take when the teeth are aligned. Of these, no more than 12 are bad $($when the tooth $A_{i}$ of the upper gear is aligned with $A_{j}$ of the lower gear, i$\neq$j$)$. Hence, there is a good position.
