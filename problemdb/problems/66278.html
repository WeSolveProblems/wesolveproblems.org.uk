<h1>Problem ID 66278</h1>
<p>
There was a football match of 10 versus 10 players between a team of liars $($ who always lie $)$ and a team of truth-tellers $($ who always tell the truth $)$. After the match, each player was asked: "How many goals did you score?" Some participants answered "one", Callum said "two", some answered "three", and the rest said "five". Is Callum lying if it is known that the truth-tellers won with a score of 20: 17?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suppose that Callum is a truth-teller. Then nine of the ten players of the truth-tellers team scored on an odd number of goals $($ one, three or five $)$, and Callum scored an even number of points. But then the team of truth-tellers scored an odd number of goals, which contradicts the condition. Consequently, our assumption is incorrect and Callum is a liar.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
He's lying.
