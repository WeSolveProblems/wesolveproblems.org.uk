<h1>Problem ID 65316</h1>
<p>
The Scattered Scientist constructed a device consisting of a sensor and a transmitter. The average life expectancy of the sensor part is 3 years, the average lifetime of the transmitter is 5 years. Knowing the distribution of the lifetime of the sensor and the transmitter, the Scattered Scientist calculated that the average lifetime of the entire device is 3 years 8 months. Was the Scattered Scientist wrong in his calculations?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Let ξ and η be the service lifetime of the sensor and the transmitter, respectively. Obviously, min $(ξ, η) \geq ξ$. Moving on to the expectations, we get that Emin $(ξ, η)\geq Eξ$ = 3. Hence, the average service life of the device is no more than three years.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
He is wrong.
