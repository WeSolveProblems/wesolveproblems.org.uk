<h1>Problem ID 98510</h1>
<p>
Authors: V.A. Senderov, V.A. Spivak
<p>
Are there such irrational numbers a and b so that a $>$ 1, b $>$ 1, and [$a^m$] is different from [$b^n$] for any natural numbers m and n?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  The first example. <img src="98510 1.png"> Note that $x^3 – y^3> x^2 – y^2$ for x $>$ y $>$ 1. Therefore <img src="98510 2.png"> $($the last inequality follows from the different parity of the numbers $3^m$ and $2^n$$)$. Hence, obviously, the statement of the problem follows.
<p>
  The second example. <img src="98510 3.png"> We set <img src="98510 4.png"> From the binomialformula it follows that the number <img src="98510 5.png"> is an integer and not a multiple of 3 $($the terms containing an odd degree $\sqrt {3}$ cancel out and all of the terms except $2^m$ are multiples of 3$)$.
<p>
  At the same time, the number $B = b^n + d^n = 3^n (a^n + c^n)$ is also an integer and divisible by 3.
  But 0 $<$ c $<$ d $<$ 1, therefore $[a^m] = A - 1 ≠ B - 1 = [b^n]$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, there are.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
1.	It's easy to come up with the right pair of numbers, if you do not require their irrationality. In fact, the requirement of irrationality is not fundamental, it only creates some technical difficulties. The solution s presented illustrate two ways to overcome these difficulties.
