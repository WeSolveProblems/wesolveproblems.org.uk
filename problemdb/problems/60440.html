<h1>Problem ID 60440</h1>
<p>
  How many integers are there from 1 to 1,000,000, which are neither full squares, nor full cubes, nor numbers to the fourth power?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
1000000 = 1000² = 100³ = 106. Therefore, in this interval there are exactly 1000 squares and 100 cubes. 10 numbers of them are numbers to the sixth power, that is, squares and cubes at the same time. All of the numbers to the fourth power are among the squares. Consequently, the condition is satisfied
1000000 - 1000 - 100 + 10 = 998910 numbers.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
998910 numbers.
