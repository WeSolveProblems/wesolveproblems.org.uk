<h1>Problem ID 35438</h1> <p>
In a group of friends, each two people have exactly five common acquaintances. Prove that the number of pairs of friends is divisible by 3.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Express the number of triples of people in pairs through the number of acquaintances.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Let P denote the number of pairs of familiar people (that is, the number of edges in the corresponding graph which you can draw yourself), and let T be the number of triangles in this graph. By assumption, each of the edges goes into exactly 5 triangles. On the other hand, each of the T triangles contains exactly 3 edges. Consequently, 5P = 3T. Since 3 and 5 are both prime numbers, P is divisible by 3.


</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
