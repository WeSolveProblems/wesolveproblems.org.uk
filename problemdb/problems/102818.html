<h1>Problem ID 102818</h1>
<p>
<b>A two-player game with matches.</b> There are 37 matches on the table. In each turn, a player is allowed to take no more than 5 matches. The winner of the game is the player who takes the final match. Which player wins, if the right strategy is used?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The first player takes 1 match in their first turn. Then for each following turn the first player takes the same number of matches as the second player (prove that this is possible). So the first player wins.
