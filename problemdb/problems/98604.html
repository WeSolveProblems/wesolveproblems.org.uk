<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  2003 dollars were placed into some wallets, and the wallets were placed in some pockets. It is known that there are more wallets in total, than there are dollars in any pocket. Is it true, that there are more pockets than there are dollars in one of the wallets? (you are not allowed to place wallets one inside the other).
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let there be $M$ wallets and $N$ pockets. Each pocket contains fewer than $M$ dollars, therefore there are fewer than $MN$ dollars in total. Therefore one of the wallets must contain less than $MN \div M = N$ dollars.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  Yes.
