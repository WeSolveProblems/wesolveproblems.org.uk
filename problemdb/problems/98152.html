<h1>Problem ID 98152</h1>
<p>
A numerical sequence is defined by the following conditions:

Prove that among the terms of this sequence there are an infinite number of complete squares.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Note that if $a_n$ = $m^2$ + k, where 1 $≤$ k $≤$ m, then $a_{n + 1}$ = $m^2$ + m + k, and $a_{n + 2}$ = $m^2$ + 2m + k = $(m + 1)^2$ + k - 1, that is, the "excess" over the square decreases by 1.
If now $a_s$ = $m^2$, then $a_{s + 1}$ = $m^2$ + m, $a_{s + 3}$ = $(m + 1)^2$ + m-1, ..., $a_{s + 2m + 1}$ = $(2m)^2$ = $4m^2$, The square is 4 times larger than the previous one. Since $a_1$ = 1, then the squares are of the form 4k and only they fall into the sequence.
