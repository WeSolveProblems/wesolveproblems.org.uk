<h1>Problem ID 35558</h1> <p>
Let M be a finite set of numbers. It is known that among any three of its elements there are two, the sum of which belongs to M.
What is the largest number of elements in M?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Consider either the four largest or the four smallest numbers.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  An example of a set of 7 elements: {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}.
<p>
  We prove that the set $M = {a_1, a_1, ..., a_n}$ for n $>$ 7 numbers does not possess the required property. We can assume that $a_1> a_2> a_3> ...> a_n$ and $a_4> 0$ $($our property does not change the signs of all elements$)$. Then $a_1 + a_2> a_1 + a_3> a_1 + a_4> a_1$, that is, none of the sums $a_1 + a_2, a_1 + a_3$ and $a_1 + a_4$ belongs to the set M. In addition, the sums $a_2 + a_3$ and $a_2 + a_4$ cannot simultaneously belong to M, since $a_2 + a_3> a_2 + a_4> a_2$. It turns out that for at least one of the triples $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and $(a_1, a_2, a_4)$, the sum of any two of its elements does not belong to the set M.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
7 elements.
