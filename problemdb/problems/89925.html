<h1>Problem ID 89925</h1>
<p>
One person says: "I'm a liar." Is he a native of the island of knights and liars?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think about whether this person can be a knight.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Both the knight and the liar will both say about themselves: "I am a knight." Therefore, this person is not an inhabitant of the Island.
</p>
