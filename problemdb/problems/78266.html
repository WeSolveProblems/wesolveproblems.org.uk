<h1>Problem ID 78266</h1> <p>
	n points are connected by segments so that each point is connected to something and there are no two points that would be connected in two different ways.
Prove that the total number of segments is n - 1.


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
See problem number 31098 b) which says the following: 
<p>
A tree has a pendant vertex $($see problem number 30786$)$. We delete it along with the edge that emerges from it. The remaining graph is also a tree. Therefore, it has a pendant vertex, which we also remove along with the edge that emerges from it. Having done this operation n - 1 times, we get a graph consisting of one vertex $($in which, of course, there are no edges$)$. Since each time exactly one edge was removed, there n -1 of them at first n - 1.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
