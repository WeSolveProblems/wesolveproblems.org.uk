<h1>Problem ID 61420</h1>
<p>
Prove that 
 <img src="61420.png">

if and only if β can be obtained from α by performing several operations $($ maybe once or none at all $)$ of the form
$(k, j, i)$ ↔ $(k - 1, j + 1, i)$, $(k, j, i)$ ↔ $(k - 1, j, i + 1)$, $(k, j, i)$ ↔ $(k, j - 1, i + 1)$.
$($ You can imagine these operations as dropping down by one brick on the Young diagram. For Young’s diagrams, see here. $)$

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Each of these three operations leads to the Young diagram, which is majorized by the diagram α. Check under what conditions the resulting diagram majorizes β, and make sure that one of these conditions is satisfied if α ≠ β.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Nothing to translate
