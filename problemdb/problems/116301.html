<h1>Problem ID 116301</h1>
<p>
  101 random points are chosen inside a unit square (including on the edges of the square), so that no three points lie on the same straight line. Prove that there exist some triangles with vertices on these points, whose area does not exceed 0.01.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  We will make use of the following statement: If the vertices of a triangle lie inside or on the edges of a rectangle, the area of the triangle cannot exceed half the area of the rectangle.
</p>
<p>
  Divide one side of the unit square into 50 equal sections, and draw lines at the boundaries of these sections parallel to the perpendicular side of the square to the one you have divided. We get 50 equal rectangles each with an area of $\frac{1}{50}$.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that at least one of these rectangles, by the pigeon hole principle must contain at least three of the given points, as otherwise the total number of points would be less than 101. The area of the triangle with vertices at these three points does not exceed half the area of the rectangle with side $1$ and $\frac{1}{50}$.. Hence, the area of this triangle does not exceed $\frac{1}{100}$.
