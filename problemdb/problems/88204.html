<h1>Problem ID 88204</h1>
<p>
Harry, Jack and Fred were seated so that Harry could see Jack and Fred, Jack could only see Fred, and Fred could not see anyone. Then, from a bag which contained two white caps and three black caps $($ the contents of the bag were known to the boys $)$, they took out and each put on a cap of an unknown color, and the other two hats remained in the sack. Harry said that he could not determine the color of his hat. Jack heard Harry’s statement and said that he did not have enough information to determine the color of his hat. Could Fred on the basis of these answers determine the color of his cap?
 
</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Under what condition could Harry determine the color of his hat?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Harry will be able to determine the color of his hat, only if both white hats are put on Fred and Jack. Since he did not name the color of his cap, it means that on Jack and Fred either there are two black caps, or - one is white, and the other is black. If Fred had a white hat, then Jack, when he heard Harry’s statement, could say that he had a black hat on. And since he did not say this, it means that Fred can be sure that he is wearing a black hat.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes. Harry can not determine the color of his own cap, which means that on Jack and Fred there are two caps that are both black or black and white. If Fred had a white hat, Jack would have determined that his own was black. So, Fred has a black hat.
