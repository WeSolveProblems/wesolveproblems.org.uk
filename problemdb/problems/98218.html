<h1>Problem ID 98218</h1>
<p>
There is a chocolate bar with five longitudinal and eight transverse grooves, along which it can be broken $($ in total into 9 * 6 = 54 squares $)$. Two players take part, in turns. A player in his turn breaks off the chocolate bar a strip of width 1 and eats it. Another player who plays in his turn does the same with the part that is left, etc. The one who breaks a strip of width 2 into two strips of width 1 eats one of them, and the other is eaten by his partner. Prove that the first player can act in such a way that he will get at least 6 more chocolate squares than the second player.
  
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The first player first breaks off a 1 × 6 strip and eats it. There remains a chocolate bar with an even number of longitudinal and transverse strips. Next further moves of the first player are repeats of the moves of the second: he breaks the strips in the same direction as the second. Therefore after the move of the second player in one direction there remains an odd number of strips, and after the turn of the first player - in both directions there is an even number of strips. Thus the first eats as many squares as the second. The game ends when the second player breaks off a strip of width 2 into two equal slices, which are taken by the players, so that they again eat an equal amount of chocolate. And so overall, the first player eats exactly six pieces more.
