<h1>Problem ID 30440</h1>
<p>
Prove that a³ + b³ + 4 is not an integer cube for any natural a and b.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Find out which remainder the number a³ + b³ + 4 can give from the division by 9.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
A cube can only give the remainder 0 or ± 1 when divided by 9. Therefore, a³ + b³ + 4 can have a remainder of 0, 2, 3, 5 or 6, which does not coincide with the remainders of cubes.
