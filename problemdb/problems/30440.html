<h1>Problem ID 30440</h1>
<p>
Two players in turn put coins on a round table, in such a way that they do not overlap. The player who can not make a move loses.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In this game, the first wins, regardless of the size of the table! For his first move he puts the coin so that the centers of the coin and the table coincide. After that, for every move of the second player, the first player responds symmetrically to the center of the table. Note that with this strategy, after each move of the first player, the position is symmetrical. Therefore, if the next move of the second player is possible, then a symmetric move for the first player is also possible. Therefore, he wins.
