<h1>Problem ID 98238</h1>
<p>
During the ball every young man danced the waltz with a girl, who was either more beautiful than the one he danced with during the previous dance, or more intelligent, but most of the men $($ at least 80% $)$ - with a girl who was at the same time more beautiful and more intelligent. Could this happen? $($ There was an equal number of boys and girls at the ball.$)$
  
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Here is one possible example. At the ball there were 10 girls and 10 boys $($ we'll give them numbers from 1, 2, ..., 10 $)$. Larger numbers signify greater beauty of the girls. The girl with the number 10 was the least intelligent of all, and the rest had increasing intelligence from the first to the ninth. In the first dance, the pairs were made up of girls and boys with the same numbers. In the second dance, the young man # 1 danced with the girl # 2, the young man # 2 - with the girl # 3, ..., the young man # 9 - with the girl # 10, the young man # 10 - with the girl # 1.
Thus, each young man from the first to the eighth danced the second dance with a girl who was at the same time more intelligent and more beautiful than the one with which he danced the first dance, the ninth young man got a girl more beautiful, and the tenth - a girl more intelligent than the one from the first dance.
