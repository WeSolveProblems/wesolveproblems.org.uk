<h1>Problem ID 64894</h1>
<p>
Solve the system of equations:
<IMG SRC="64894 1.gif">.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We write the system in the form <IMG SRC="64894 2.gif">. Note that the function $f (t) = sin t + t$ is strictly increasing. Indeed, $f '(t) = cost + 1 ≥ 0$; moreover, the derivative takes the value 0 for t = π + 2kπ, k ∈ Z, that is, there are no intervals on which $f '(t) = 0$. Consequently, each function $f (t)$ takes its own value only for one value of the variable. Hence, x = y = z, x - y + z = π, from where we get x = y = z = π.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
$(π, π, π)$.
