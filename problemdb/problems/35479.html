<h1>Problem ID 35479</h1> <p>
At a round table, 10 boys and 15 girls were seated. It turned out that there are exactly 5 pairs of boys sitting next to each other.
How many pairs of girls are sitting next to each other?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
How many groups of boys that are sitting next to each other are there at the table?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Groups of boys sitting in a row alternate with groups of girls sitting in a row. We denote the number of groups of boys sitting next to each other by k. Then the number of groups of girls sitting next to each other is also k. In a group of n boys sitting in a row there is exactly the n - 1 pair of boys sitting next to each other. Since we have only 10 boys and k groups, then there are only 10 - k pairs of boys sitting next to each other. By the condition k = 5. Consequently, the number of pairs of girls sitting next to each other is 15 - 5 = 10.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
10 pairs.
