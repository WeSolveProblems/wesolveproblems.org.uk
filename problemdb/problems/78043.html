<h1>Problem ID 78043</h1>
<p>
  The expression $ax^2+bx+c$ is an exact fourth power for all integer $x$. Prove that $a=b=0$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  It is clear that $a \ge 0$ and $c \ge 0$. Consider values of $x$ from $1, 2, ..., n$. If either of $a$ or $b$ was not equal to 0, then the expression $ax^2+bx+c$ would take at least $n/2$ different values for these values of $x$. These values lie between $0$ and $an^2+|b|n+c$. However the number of different fourth power numbers within these limits does not exceed $\sqrt[4]{an^2+|b|n+c} +1$. Therefore $\sqrt[4]{an^2+|b|n+c} +1 \ge \frac{n}{2}$, that is $an^2+|b|n+c \ge (\frac{n}{2}-1)^4$. For large $n$ such an inequality cannot hold true, since $\frac{n^4}{16}$ will be significantly larger than $an^2$.
