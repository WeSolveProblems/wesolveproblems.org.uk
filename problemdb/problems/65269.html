<h1>Problem ID 65269</h1>
<p>
In the first term of the year Daniel received five grades in mathematics with each of them being on a scale of 1 to 5, and the most common grade among them was a 5 . In this case it turned out that the median of all his grades was 4, and the arithmetic mean was 3.8. What grades could Daniel have?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
We write out Daniel’s grades in ascending order. On the third $($middle$)$ place a 4 will stand. Hence, two grades standing to the right of it can only be $($4, 4$)$, $($4, 5$)$ or $($5, 5$)$. The first two options are not suitable, since then there will be more fours than fives, which contradicts the condition. Hence, the last two grades are fives. Since the average of all the grades is 3.8, the sum of all five grades is $3.8 \times 5$ = 19. Hence, the first two grades $($standing to the left of the four$)$ when added together equal 19 - 5 - 5 - 4 = 5. Therefore, they can only be $($1, 4$)$ or $($2, 3$)$. The first option is impossible, because otherwise Daniel would have an equal number of fours and fives. Hence, Daniel’s grades are $($2, 3, 4, 5, 5$)$.
