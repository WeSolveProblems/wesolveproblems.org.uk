<h1>Problem ID 78175</h1>
<p>
Note that if you turn over a sheet on which numbers are written, then the digits 0, 1, 8 will not change and the digits 6 and 9 will switch places, whilst the others will lose their meaning. How many nine-digit numbers exist that do not change when a sheet is turned over?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
All such numbers must consist of digits that have meaning when the sheet of paper is turned over, and the number is determined by its first five digits. Note that the fifth digit cannot be 6 or 9, and also the first digit cannot be 0. So, for the first digit, we have 4 options, for the second, third and fourth digits â€“ 5 options, and for the fifth digit - 3 options. Thus, the total number of such numbers is $4 \times 5^3 \times 3$ = 1500.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
1500 numbers.
