<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  In March 2015 a teacher ran 11 sessions of a maths club. Prove, that if no sessions were run on Saturdays or Sundays, that there must have been three days in a row, where a session of the club did not take place. The 1st March 2015 was a Sunday.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Assume that it was possible to run exactly 11 sessions in March, so that no sessions took place on Saturdays or Sundays, and so that in any three consecutive days at least one session took place. In this situation, a session must have taken place the day before Saturday and Sunday (i.e. Friday) and the day after Saturday and Sunday (i.e. Monday). Therefore sessions must have taken place on the 6th, 9th, 13th, 16th, 20th, 23rd, 27th and 30th of the month (8 sessions). On top of this, between Tuesday and Thursday of each week, at least one session must have taken place. Therefore at least 4 further sessions are necessary. This gives a total of 12 sessions. This contradiction proves, that there must have been three consecutive days, in which no session of the club took place.
