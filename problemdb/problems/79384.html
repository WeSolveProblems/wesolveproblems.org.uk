<h1>Problem ID 79384</h1>
<p>
There are several squares on a rectangular sheet of chequered paper of size $m \times n$ cells, the sides of which run along the vertical and horizontal lines of the paper. It is known that no two squares coincide and no square contains another square within itself. What is the largest number of such squares?
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Letâ€™s mark the upper left corner of each square. By hypothesis, for different squares the marked points are different. Therefore, the number of squares does not exceed mn. It is also clear that mn cells have the required property, therefore the number of squares can be equal to mn.

</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
mn squares.
