</p>
 
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
On the domain of definition, the equation can be reduced to the form x + 1 + x / $($x + 1$)$ = 1. Multiply both sides of the equation by x + 1. After simplification, we get: $x^2$ + 2x = 0, that is, x = 0 or x = -2. The root of the equation is only x = -2.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
-2
