<h1>Problem ID 35541</h1>
<p>
Solve the equation $ 2x^x = \ sqrt {2} $ for positive numbers.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Find one of the solutions and prove that there are no others.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We divide both sides of the equation by 2 to obtain $ x^x = \sqrt {1/2} $. It is easy to verify that x = 1/2 and x = 1/4 are solutions of this equation. We show that there are no other solutions. We find the intervals of monotonicity of the function $x^x$. Its derivative $(x^x) '= (e^{xlnx})' = (lnx + 1) (e^{xlnx}) = (lnx + 1) (x^x)$ is negative on the interval $(0, 1/e)$ and positive on the ray x $>$ 1/e. Consequently, the function $x^x$ is monotonic on each of these intervals, and hence there are no more than two positive solutions of our equation.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
x = 1/4, x = 1/2.
