<h1>Problem ID 30429</h1> <p>
In the Far East, the only type of transport is a carpet-plane. From the capital there are 21 carpet-planes, from the city of Dalny there is one carpet-plane, and from all of the other cities there are 20. Prove that you can fly from the capital to Dalny $($possibly with interchanges$)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We consider the connected component of the graph of carpet-planes containing the capital. Suppose that it does not contain Dalny. Then in this component of connectivity, from one vertex $($there capital$)$ there are 21 edges, and from all of the other vertices there are 20 edges. Thus, in this subgraph there is exactly one odd vertex. This contradicts problem number 87972 b).

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
