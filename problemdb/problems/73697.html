<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  A sequence of natural numbers $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < ... < a_n < ...$ is such, that each natural number is either a term in the sequence, or can be expressed as the sum of two terms in the sequence ( or perhaps the same term twice). Prove that $a_n \leq n^2 $ for any $n=1, 2, 3,...$
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider the first $n-1$ terms of the sequence
</p>
<p>
  $$ a_1, ..., a_n_-_1 \tag{1} $$
</p>
<p>
  and all of the natural numbers that needed to be presented as the sum of two terms in the sequence
</p>
<p>
  $$ a_1 + a_1, a_1 + a_2, ..., a_n + a_n \tag{2} $$
</p>
<p>
  The total number of terms in $(1)$ and $(2)$ does not exceed $ (n-1) + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} < n^2 $.
</p>
<p>
  Thus there must be a natural number between $1$ and $n^2$ that is not expressed by any of the terms in $\tag{1}$ or $\tag{2}$. Hence $a_n \leq n^2 $.
</p>
<h1>Note</h1>
<p>
  We have effectively proven that $a_n \leq \frac {n(n+1)} {2} $
</p>
