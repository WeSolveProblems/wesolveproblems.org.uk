<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  In a volleyball tournament teams play each other once. A win gives the team 1 point, a loss - 0 points. It is known, that at one point in the tournament all of the teams had different numbers of points. How many points did the team in second last place have at the end of the tournament, and what was the result of its match against the eventually winning team?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let there be $n$ teams taking part in the tournament. This means that there are a total of $ \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ points available in the tournament. Teams could only all have different numbers of points $(0, 1, ..., n-1)$ after the end of the tournament. Therefore the team in second last place had one point and lost against the winning team.
