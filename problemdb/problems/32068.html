<h1>Problem ID 32068</h1>
<p>A square area of size 100x100 is covered in tiles of size 1x1 in 4 different colours - white, red, black, and grey. No two tiles of the same colour touch one another, that is share a side or a corner. How many red tiles can there be?</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Split the square area into 2,500 2x2 zones, each of which consists of 4 tiles with a shared corner. This means each zone can contain no more than 1 red square, therefore there can be no more than 2,500 red tiles in the square area. The same is true for the other three colours, so there must be exactly 2,500 tiles of each colour.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>2500 red tiles.</p>

<h1> Note </h1>
<p>Such an arrangement is possible if we construct a 2x2 zone with one tile of each colour, and then place 2,500 such zones in the square area such that all of the 2x2 zones have the same orientation. </p>
