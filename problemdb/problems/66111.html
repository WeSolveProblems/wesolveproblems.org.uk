<h1>Problem ID 66111</h1>
<p>
We took several positive numbers and constructed the following sequence: $a_1$ is the sum of the initial numbers, $a_2$ is the sum of the squares of the original numbers, $a_3$ is the sum of the cubes of the original numbers, and so on.
<p>
a$)$ Could it happen that up to $a_5$ the sequence decreases $($a_1> a_2> a_3> a_4> a_5$)$, and starting with $a_5$ - it increases $($a_5 $<$a_6 $<$a_7 <...$)$?
<p>
b$)$ Could it be the other way around: before a_5 the sequence increases, and starting with a_5 - decreases?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
a$)$ Example 1. Take the number 2 and 1024 numbers equal to ½. Then $a_n$ = $2^n$ + $1024 times 2^{-n}$ = 32 $($2^{n-5} + 2^{5-n}$)$. The sum of two positive reciprocal inverses is smaller, the closer they are to each other. Therefore, the constructed sequence decreases until n = 5, and then increases.
<p>
Example 2. Take $a_n$ = $1.02^n$ + $0.5^n$. Note that $a_{n + 1}$ $>$ $a_n$ ⇔ $0.02 \times 1.02^n$ $>$ $0.5^{n + 1}$ ⇔ $2.04^n$ $>$ 25 ⇔ n $≥$ 5. That is, the sequence decreases until n = 5, and then increases.
<p>
b$)$ Suppose this happens. The first method. Then $a_n$ $<$ $a_54 for any n. Among the initial numbers was the number x $>$ 1, otherwise the sequence would never increase. Notice that
$a_n$ $>$ $x^n$ for any n. But the sequence $x^n$ is not bounded. So we have a contradiction.
<p>
The second method. Then $a_4$ $<$ $a_5$ and $a_6$ $<$ $a_5$, that is, $a_4$ + $a_6$ $<$ $2a_5$. Hence, $x^4$ + $x^6$ $<$ $2x^5$ for at least one of the original numbers x. But this contradicts the Cauchy inequality.
