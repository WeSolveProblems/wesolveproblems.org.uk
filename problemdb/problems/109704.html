<h1>Problem ID 109704</h1>

Author: A. Khrabrov
<p>
Prove that for any positive integer n the inequality <IMG SRC="109704 1.gif"> is true. 

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  For n = 1, the inequality becomes 0 = 0. For n$>$ 1, we prove that the sum of the fractional parts on each interval between two successive squares satisfies the inequality <IMG SRC="109704 2.gif">
<p>
  From the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the mean square, we obtain <IMG SRC="109704 3.gif"> for 0 ≤ a ≤ m.
<p>
  Consequently, <IMG SRC="109704 4.gif">
<p>
  Summing these inequalities for a = 0, 1, ..., m-1 and the inequality <IMG SRC="109704 5.gif"> $(obtained by dividing by 2 the two parts of (2) for a = m)$, we arrive at inequality $($1$)$. Summing the inequality $($1$)$ over all m from 1 to n - 1, we obtain <<IMG SRC="109704 6.gif">
<p>

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
