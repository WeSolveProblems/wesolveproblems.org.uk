<h1>Problem ID 88025</h1>
<p>
In Wonderland, an investigation was conducted into the case of a stolen soup. At the trial, the White Rabbit said that the soup was stolen by the Mad Hatter. The Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter also testified, but what they said, no one remembered, and the record was washed away by Aliceâ€™s tears. During the court session, it became clear that only one of the defendants had stolen the soup and that only he had given a truthful testimony. So, who stole the soup? 


<h1>Hint</h1>
Think about why the White Rabbit cannot be the thief.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The White Rabbit cannot be the thief, because the thief told the truth, and the White Rabbit, in this case, lied. The Mad Hatter cannot be the thief, because, in this case, the White Rabbit told the truth, but only the thief told the truth. So, the thief is the Cheshire Cat.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
The soup was stolen by the Cheshire Cat.
