<h1>Problem ID 30811</h1>
<p>
Each of the 102 pupils of one school is friends with at least 68 others. Prove that among them there are four who have the same number of friends.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Letâ€™s suppose the contrary is true. Then for each number from 68 to 101 there are exactly three people who have such a number of friends. But then the number of people who have an odd number of friends is odd. This is a contradiction.
