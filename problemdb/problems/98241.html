<h1>Problem ID 98241</h1>
<p>
A 1 Ã— 10 strip is divided into unit squares. The numbers 1, 2, ..., 10 are written into squares. First, the number 1 is written in one square, then the number 2 is written into one of the neighboring squares, then the number 3 is written into one of the neighboring squares of those already occupied, and so on $($ the choice of the first square is made arbitrarily and the choice of the neighbor at each step $)$. In how many ways can this be done?
  
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Obviously the numbers to the left of 1 stand in descending order, and on the right - in increasing order. Therefore, the string is uniquely determined by the choice of a subset of numbers that will stand to the left of the unit. There are known to be 29 such subsets in the set {2, ..., 10} of 9 elements.
