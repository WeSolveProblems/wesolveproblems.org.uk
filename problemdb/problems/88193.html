<h1>Problem ID 88193</h1>
<p>
In an ordinary set of dominoes, there are 28 tiles. How many tiles would a set of dominoes contain if the values indicated on the tiles did not range from 0 to 6, but from 0 to 12?
</p>



<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to understand why, in the standard set of dominoes, there are 28 tiles.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In this set, there would be 13 "doubles." The number of remaining tiles is equal to the number of pairs of 13 numbers, that is, $13 \times 12$/2 = 78.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	91 tiles.
