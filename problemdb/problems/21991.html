<h1>Problem ID 21991</h1>
<p>100 people are sitting around a round table. More than half of them are men. Prove that there are two males sitting opposite one another.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Split the 100 people into 50 pairs, such that each pair sits opposite one another around the table. It is clear that in at least one of these pairs, both 'slots' will be filled by men.</p>
