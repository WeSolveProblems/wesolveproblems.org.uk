<h1>Problem ID 30788</h1>
<p>
Prove that when you remove any edge from a tree, it turns into a disjointed graph.</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Suppose that the ends of the removed edge in the new graph are connected by a simple path. Then this path, together with the removed edge, forms a cycle in the initial graph.
