<h1>Problem ID 65315</h1>
<p>
40% of adherents of some political party are women. 70% of the adherents of this party are townspeople. At the same time, 60% of the townspeople who support the party are men. Are the events "the adherent of the party is a townsperson" and "the adherent of party is a woman" independent?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  Let event A be "the adherent of party is a woman", and B be "the adherent of the party is a townsperson". By assumption, P $($A$)$ = 0.4.
<p>
  70% of party voters live in the city and 60% of them are men. Therefore, the remaining 40% are women, that is, the proportion of women among the townspeople is the same as among all of the voters. Hence, P $($A|B$)$ = 0.4.
<p>
  The unconditional probability of event A and the conditional probability of this event under condition B is the same. This indicates independence of events.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Yes, they are independent.
