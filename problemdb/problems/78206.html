<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  30 pupils in years 7 to 11 took part in the creation of 40 maths problems. Every possible pair of pupils in the same year created the same number of problems. Every possible pair of pupils in different years created a different number of problems. How many pupils created exactly one problem?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Pick 5 students, one from each year taking part. Since the number of problems each created is different, these pupils between them created no fewer than $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5=15$ problems. Hence the remaining 25 pupils between them created no more than $40 - 15 = 25$ problems. That is, each one must created exactly one problem. Therefore a total of 26 pupils created exactly one problem.
</p>
<p>
  Such a scenario is indeed possible - for example where all the year 7s created 1 problem, all the year 8s - 2 problems and so on, and exactly 26 year 7s took part, with one pupil from each of the other four years.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  26 pupils.
