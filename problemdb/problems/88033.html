<h1>Problem ID 88033</h1>
<p>
A wealthy senator died and was outlived by his pregnant wife. After the death of the senator, it turned out that he made the following will for his property equal to 210 talents: "In the case of the birth of a son, give the boy two thirds of my property, and the rest to my wife, in the case of the birth of a daughter, give the girl one third of my property, and the remaining two thirds to my wife ". The widow of the senator gave birth to twins - a boy and a girl. The senator did not foresee such a possibility. How can you divide the property between the three heirs with the best approximation to the condition of the will?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Since all of the requirements of the senator cannot be fulfilled, it is necessary to fulfil only some of them. There will be different ways of dividing up the assets, depending on which requirements you are fulfilling.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since all of the requirements of the senator cannot be fulfilled, it is necessary to fulfil only some of them. There will be different ways of dividing up the assets, depending on which requirements you are fulfilling. Therefore, there are many options. Let us examine some of them.
<p>
1)	From the first condition, it follows that the son must receive 2/3 of the estate, and from the second condition - that the daughter should receive two times less than the mother. Then the son will receive 140 talents, the daughter – 23 1/3, and the mother – 46 2/3.
<p>
2)	From the first condition of the will it follows that the mother's share is half the share of the son, and from the second - that this share is twice the daughter's share. Then the son will receive 120 talents, the mother - 60, and the daughter - 30.
<p>
4)	The mother's share is not less than 1/3, and the son's share is 4 times greater than the daughter's share. Then both the mother and the son will receive 70 talents, the daughter - 28, and the son - 112.
<p>
You can suggest other options.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
This task arose from practice. Such a case actually occurred in Ancient Rome. There, the court divided the inheritance as proposed in the second version.
