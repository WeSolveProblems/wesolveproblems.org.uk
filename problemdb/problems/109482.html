<h1>Problem ID 109482</h1>
<p>
A row of 4 coins lies on the table. Some of the coins are real and some of them are fake (the ones which weigh less than the real ones). It is known that any real coin lies to the left of any false coin. How can you determine whether each of the coins on the table is real or fake, by weighing once using a balance scale?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We shall number the coins from left to righ. Since there must be at least one real coin and at least one fake coin, so the first coin is real and the fourth is fake. We must now determine whether the second and third coins are each real or fake. Any real coin lies to the left of any false coin, so we have the following four cases for the four coins (from left to right): 1) real, real, real, fake; 2) real, real, fake, fake; 3) real, fake, fake, fake.
<br>
Let us place the first and fourth coins in the left cup of the balance scale and the second and third coins in the right cup.
<br>
1) If the right cup weighs more, then it contains only real coins and so the second and third coins are real.
<br>
2) If the left and right cups weigh the same then each cup contains one real coin and one fake coin. So the second coin is real and the third is fake.
<br>
3)If the left cup weighs more, then the right cup contains two fake coins. That is, the second and third coins are fake.
