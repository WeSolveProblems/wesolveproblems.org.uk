<h1>Problem ID 79488</h1>
<p>
  The product of 1986 natural numbers has exactly 1985 different prime factors. Prove that either one of these natural numbers, or the product of several of them is the square of a natural number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider the original set of 1986 numbers, grouped singly, in pairs, groups of 3 and son on. In total there are $2^1^9^8^6-1$ such possible groups. We will take the numbers in each group, multiply them together and express the product in the form of the largest possible square number multiplied by some prime factors (for example $2^1^6 \times 3^1^5 \times 5^1^3 \times 17^9 = \(2^8 \times 3^7 \times 5^6 \times 17^4 \)^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7$ and $2*1^6 \times 13^10 = \(2^8 \times 13^5 \)^2$). For each of the groups, assign the set of prime factors created when the product of each group is divided by the largest square factor (so for the previous examples the first would have 3, 5, 7 and the second set would be empty). The number of different possible groups from 1985 prime factors is equal to $2^1^9^8^5$, which is less than the $2^1^9^8^6-1$ groups possible from the original numbers. Therefore some two groups $A$ and $B$ will correspond to the same set of prime factors, that is $A = a^2p_1p_2 ...p_k, B=b^2p_1...p_k$.

  Therefore the product $AB$ will give a perfect square $C$. Furthermore, $AB$ is equal to the product of the numbers in group $A$ and the numbers in group $B$. By throwing out from group $A$ and $B$ any numbers which occur in both (which will multiply to give a perfect square) we get that the product of the remaining numbers will also be a perfect square.
