<h1>Problem ID 60963</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to draw from some point on a plane n tangents to a polynomial of n-th power?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The equation of the tangent to the graph of the polynomial P$(x)$ at the point $(x_0, P (x_0))$ has the form y - P $(x_0)$ = P '$(x_0)$ $(x – x_0)$. Let the tangents at the points $(x_k, P (x_k))$ $(k = 0, 1, ..., n)$ pass through the point $(a, b)$. Then b - P $(x_k)$ = P '$(x_k)$ $(a – x_k)$, that is, the polynomial P $(x)$ - P' $(x)$ $(x - a)$ - b, whose degree is not greater than n, has n + 1 roots. This gives us a contradiction.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
No, you cannot.
