<h1>Problem ID 103781</h1>
<p>
A pedestrian walked along six streets of one city, passing each street exactly twice, but could not get around them, having passed each one only once. Could this be?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Consider six streets emerging from the centre of the city in different directions $($that is, six segments with a common start point and without other common points$)$. A pedestrian can, after leaving the centre, go back and forth on each street. But, obviously, it's impossible to walk on every street exactly once.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes, this could be.
