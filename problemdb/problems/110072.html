<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  A target consists of a triangle, divided by three families of parallel lines into 100 equilateral unit triangles. A sniper shoots at the target. He aims at a particular equilateral triangle, and either hits it, or hits one of the adjacent triangles that share a side with the one he was aiming for. He can see the results of his shots, and can choose when to stop shooting. What is the largest number of triangles that the sniper can guarantee he can hit exactly 5 times?

<p>
  We will show that the sniper can always hit 25 triangles 5 times. Consider the target divided into 25 triangular sections of side length 2 - that is consisting of 4 triangles (see the diagram). Then, by shooting at the centre triangle in each section, until one of the equilateral triangles is hit exactly 5 times, he will get a total of 25 such triangles.
</p>

<p>
  We will prove that the sniper cannot guarantee more than 25 triangles will be hit in this way. Indeed by aiming at a random triangle in a given section, a shot can always hit the centre triangle of that section. Therefore the number of triangles hit 5 times cannot be guaranteed to exceed 25.

  25
