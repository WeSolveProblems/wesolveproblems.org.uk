<h1>Problem ID 35427</h1>
<p>
A daisy has a) 12 petals; b) 11 petals. Consider the game with two players where: in one turn a player is allowed to remove either exactly one petal or two petals which are next to each other. The loser is the one who cannot make a turn. How should the second player act, in cases a) and b), in order to win the game regardless of the moves of the first player?

</p>

<p>


</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The second player always the option to make moves symmetric to those of the first player.


</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a) We shall number the petals, say, clockwise. Let us separate them into pairs: 1 with 7, 2 with 8, 3 with 9, 4 with 10, 5 with 11, 6 with 12. 
We notice that the petals in each pair are not next to each other, that is, they can't both be torn off by one player. Then, whichever petals are removed by the first player, the second player can remove the other petal(s) in the corresponding pair. 

</p>

<p>
b) We shall number the petals again from 1 to 11. There are two possible cases. First case: the first player removes one petal, e.g. petal 1, then the second player removes two petals, e.g. 6 and 7. Then we separate the remaining petals into pairs, and the second player removes the petals corresponding to those removed by the first player. Second case: the first player removes two petals, e.g. 1 and 2, then the second player removes petals 6 and 7. Then we separate the remaining petals into pairs and the second player removes petals pairwise as before. Thus the second player wins.
