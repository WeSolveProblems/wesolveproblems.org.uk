<h1>Problem ID 111682</h1>
<p>
100 queens, that cannot capture each other, are placed on a $100 \times 100$ chessboard.
Prove that at least one queen is in each $50 \times 50$ corner square. 

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose there are no queens in the upper left $50 \times 50$ square. Then, all 50 queens on the 50 upper horizontals are in the upper right $50 \times 50$ square, and all 50 queens on the 50 left verticals are in the bottom left square. But both these squares are covered by 99 diagonals, so there are no more than 99 queens. This is a contradiction.
