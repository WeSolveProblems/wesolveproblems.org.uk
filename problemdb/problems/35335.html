<h1>Problem ID 35335</h1>
<p>
Two boys play the following game: they take turns placing rooks on a chessboard. The one who wins is the one whose last move leaves all the board cells filled. Who wins if both try to play with the best possible strategy?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Symmetrical moves.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The second boy will win if he places his rooks symmetrically to the rooks of the first player relative to the centre of the board.
