<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Prove that in any group of 6 people, there are either three pairs of people who know one another, or three pairs of people who do not know one another.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>A given person in the group, amongst the 5 other members of the group has either no fewer than three people they know, or no fewer than three people they do not know. Let us consider the first case. Among the three people they know, there will be two people who know one another - in which case those two along with the person we initally considered make up three pairs of people between them, or there will be three people who do not know one another - in which cases the second possibility given in the question is true.</p>
