<h1>Problem ID 116474</h1>
<p>
Four numbers (from 1 to 9) have been used to create two numbers with four-digits each. These two numbers are the maximum and minimum numbers, respectively, possible. The sum of these two numbers is equal to 11990. What could the two numbers be?

</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let us call the four numbers which make up the other two be $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ in increasing order. Then the smallest four digit number made up of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ is $ABCD$ and the biggest is $DCBA$. Thus we get the rebus $ABCD + DCBA = 11990$. (Note that different letters could stand for the same number.) It immediately follows that $A + D = 10$. Therefore a 1 would carry from the hundreds digit to the thousands digit (in the sum), which means that $B+C>9$. Then from the tens digit we can see that $B+C=18$. Then $B=C=9$. It follows that $D=9$ and $A=1$.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
9991 and 1999.
