<h1>Problem ID 98665</h1>
<p>
Several natives of an island met up (each either a liar or a knight), and everyone said to everyone else: "You are all liars." How many knights were there among them?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think, could there be, for example, 3 knights?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
There cannot be two (or more) knights because then the statement made by the knight will not be true. In general, one cannot do without knights - then the statements of all of the liars will be true. There remains only one possibility - 1 knight, the rest - liars.
</p>
