<h1>Problem ID 89907</h1>
<p>
<i>This problem is from Ancient Rome.</i>
<br>
A rich senator died, leaving his wife pregnant. After the senator's death it was found out that he left a property of 210 talents &#40;an Ancient Roman currency&#41; in his will as follows: "In the case of the birth of a son, give the boy two thirds of my property &#40;i.e. 140 talents&#41; and the other third &#40;i.e. 70 talents&#41; to the mother. In the case of the birth of a daughter, give the girl one third of my property &#40;i.e. 70 talents&#41; and the other two thirds &#40;i.e. 140 talents&#41; to the mother."
<br>
The senator's widow gave birth to twins: one boy and one girl. This possibility was not foreseen by the late senator. How can the property be divided between three inheritors so that it is as close as possible to the instructions of the will?
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Since it is impossible to fulfill all of the instructions in the will, you must only fulfill some of them. The method you use will depend on which part of the instructions you pick.

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since it is impossible to fulfill all of the instructions in the will, we must only fulfill some of them. The method we use will depend on which part of the instructions we pick. There are many possibilities. For example: 
<br>
1&#41; From the first condition of the will it follows that the son must receive 2/3 of the inheritance and from the second condition it follows that the daughter must receive half the amount the mother receives.
<br>
2&#41; From the first condition it follows that the mother receives half the amount the son receives and from the second condition it follows that this portion is twice the amount the daughter receives.
<br>
3&#41;In each condition the mother does not receive less than a third while the son's inheritance is 4 times that of the daughter. 
<br>
Other options are also possible. This problem came from reality. Such a situation actually happened in Ancient Rome. The inheritance was divided by a court as in case 2&#41;: 4/7 of the property went to the son &#40;i.e. 120 talents&#41;, 2/7 to the mother &#40;i.e. 60 talents&#41; and 1/7 to the daughter &#40;i.e. 30 talents&#41;.
