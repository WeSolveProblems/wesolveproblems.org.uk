<h1>Problem ID 60921</h1>
<p>
There are 4 coins. Of the four coins, one is fake $($it differs in weight from the real ones, but it is not known if it is heavier or lighter$)$. Find the fake coin using two weighings on scales without weights.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
First you should compare the 1st and 2nd coins, then the 1st and 4th coins.
