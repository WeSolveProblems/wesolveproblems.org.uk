<h1>Problem ID 35428</h1>
<p>
On the board the number 1 is written. Two players in turn add any number from 1 to 5 to the number on the board and write down the total instead. The player who first makes the number thirty on the board wins. Specify a winning strategy for the second player.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
You can not specify such a strategy.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The first player has a winning situation. On his first move, he can add five, i.e. write down the amount of six. Whichever number the second player writes, the first one always has the opportunity to bring the sum to a multiple of six, i.e. after the moves of the first, the sum will be 6, 12, 18, 24, and then, no matter how many numbers the second player writes, the first can take all the remaining ones, since there will remain no more than five and so the first player will be able to write the number 30.
