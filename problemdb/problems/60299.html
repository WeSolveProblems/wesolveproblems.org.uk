<h1>Problem ID 60299</h1>
<p>
 From the set of numbers 1 to 2n, n + 1 numbers are chosen. Prove that among the chosen numbers there are two, one of which is divisible by another.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Consider the largest odd divisors of the selected numbers. The numbers from 1 to 2n have exactly n distinct largest odd divisors $($numbers 1, 3, ..., 2n - 1$)$. So, two of the selected numbers have the same largest odd divisors. This means that the two chosen numbers differ only in that the factor 2 enters into them in different degrees. The greater of them is divided into smaller.
