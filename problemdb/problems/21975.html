<h1>Problem</h1>
In Latvia there are $m$ football teams (containing 11 football players each). All of the players met at the airport in order to travel to another country for a match. The plane made 10 journeys from Latvia to the country, carrying 10 passengers each time. One player also flew to the location of the match by helicopter. Prove that at least one team made it in its entirety to the other country to play the match.

<h1>Solution</h1>
In total $10m+1$ players were transported to the match. If we separate these players into $m$ groups, at least 1 must contain 11 players.
