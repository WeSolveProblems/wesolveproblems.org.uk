<h1>Problem ID 35573</h1>
<p>
Let f be a continuous function defined on the interval [0; 1] such that f $(0)$ = f $(1)$ = 0. Prove that on the segment [0; 1] there are 2 points at a distance of 0.1 at which the function f 4(x)$ takes equal values.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Consider the difference between the function and its shift along the Ox axis by 0.1.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We consider the maximal value of the modulus of the function at the points 0; 0.1; 0.2; ...; 0.9; 1. Let it be achieved at the point m = k / 10. There are three possible cases: f $(m)$ = 0, f $(m)$ $>$ 0 and f $(m)$ $<$ 0. In the first of them, the function is zero at all the points indicated above, and the statement of the problem is fulfilled. The remaining two cases are identical, we will analyze the first of them. We know that: m is different from 0 and 1, f $(m-0,1)$ $\leq$ f $(m)$ $\geq$ f $(m + 0,1)$. Consider the function g $(x)$ = f $(x + 0,1)$ -f $(x)$. It is continuous and g $(m-0,1)$ $\geq$ 0, g $(m)$ $\leq$ 0. By the intermediate value theorem, there exists a number x lying between m-0,1 and m, such that g $(x)$ = 0. We get that f $(x)$ = f $(x + 0,1)$, and the required number is found.
