<h1>Problem ID 61443</h1>
<p>
The exponent $y = e^x$ is a function for which the conditions $y '(x) = y (x)$ and $y (0) = 1$ are satisfied. Which sequence ${a_n}$ will have similar properties if the derivative is replaced by the difference operator $ \Delta $ ?

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
$a_n = 2^n$.
