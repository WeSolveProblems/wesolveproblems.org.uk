<h1>Problem ID 30831</h1>
<p>
In the country called Orientation a one-way traffic system was introduced on all the roads, and each city can be reached from any other one by driving on no more than two roads. One road was closed for repairs but from every city it remained possible to get to any other. Prove that for every two cities this can still be done whilst driving on no more than 3 roads.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let the road leading from A to B be closed. Consider two arbitrary cities C and D, different from A and B.
<p>
1$)$ Prior to the closure of the road AB from C to D one could drive along either one or two roads. Obviously, none of them coincides with AB. Therefore, the closing of the road AB will not affect the travel from C to D.
<p>
2$)$ After closing the road AB by the condition the path from A to B was left. Let E be the last city on this path in front of B. As shown above, from C to E you can drive this distance by going on no more than two roads. Hence, from C to B you can drive in at most three roads.
Similarly, it is proven that from A one can travel to D in at most three roads.
<p>
3$)$ Before closing the road AB, from A to E, you could drive the distance in at most two roads. Obviously, none of them coincides with AB. Therefore, after closing the road AB, from A to B you can drive in at most three roads $($ along the route AEB $)$.
