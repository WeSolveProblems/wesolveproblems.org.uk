<h1>Problem ID 64533</h1>
<p>
In the entry * + * + * + * + * + * + * + * = ** replace the asterisks with different digits so that the equality is correct.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 = 36.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
The above example is unique up to the order of the terms on the left-hand side of the equation. Indeed, suppose that there is a number ab on the right hand side. Since the sum of ten different digits is 45, this equation can be written in the form 45 - a - b = 10a + b, that is
11a + 2b = 45. Since $2b \leq 18$, the only option is a = 3, b = 6.
