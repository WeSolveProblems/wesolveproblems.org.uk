<h1>Problem ID 102964</h1>
<p>
Petya and Misha play such a game. Petya takes in each hand a coin: one - 10 pence, and the other - 15. After that, the contents of the left hand are multiplied by 4, 10, 12 or 26, and the contents of the right hand - by 7, 13, 21 or 35. Then Petya adds the two results and tells Misha the result. Can Misha, knowing this result, determine which hand - the right or left – contains the 10 pence coin? 
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note that the contents of Petya’s left hand is multiplied by an even number, and the contents of the right-hand side by an odd number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The contents of Petya’s left hand is multiplied by an even number, and the contents of the right hand by an odd number. The first of these products is even, so the sum of both products will be either even or odd, depending on whether the second product is even or odd. This will in turn either be even or odd just as the coin in the right hand. So, if Petya got an odd result, then he has 15 pence in his right hand, and if even, then 10 pence.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	Yes, Misha can.
