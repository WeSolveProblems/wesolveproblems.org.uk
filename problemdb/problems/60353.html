<h1>Problem ID 60353</h1>
<p>
  Some points from a finite set are connected by line segments. Prove that two points can be found which have the same number of line segments connected to them.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If there are $n$ points, then there can be between 0 and $n-1$ lines connected to a given point. However there cannot be two points such that $n-1$ are connected to one point and 0 to the other. This means that there are only $n-1$ possible values for the number of lines connected, so there must be at least two points with the same number of lines connected.
