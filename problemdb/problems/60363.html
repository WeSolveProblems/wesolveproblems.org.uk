<h1>Problem ID 60363</h1>
<p>
  A rectangular table is given, in each cell of which a real number is written, and in each row of the table the numbers are arranged in ascending order. Prove that if you arrange the numbers in each column of the table in ascending order, then in the rows of the resulting table, the numbers will still be in ascending order.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
See problem 73606 a).
<p>
Consider a table with numbers in each row in ascending order.
   Let us prove that the kth number in magnitude, $b_k$, $($counting from the largest$)$ in the rth column is not less than the kth number $a_k$ in the l-th column. Indeed, in the l-th column there are k numbers not less than $a_k$. In the same rows in the r-th column there are k numbers not less than $a_k$. Therefore $a_k â‰¤ b_k$.
<p>
   Hence the statement of the problem follows.
