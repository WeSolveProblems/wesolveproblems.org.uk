<h1>Problem ID 21976</h1>
<p>You are given 8 different natural numbers that are no greater than 15. Prove that there are three pairs of these numbers whose positive difference is the same.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>There are 14 possible values for the difference between a pair - the numbers from 1 to 14. There are 28 possible pairs of numbers - $\frac{8 \times 7}{2}$ meaning that there are 28 number-pairs to fit into 14 categories. This gives exactly two pairs in each category - or two pairs which share the same difference. However there is only one pair of values that has a difference of 14 - the numbers 15 and 1. Therefore there are 27 pairs of numbers that need to be split between 13 categories. Thus by the pigeon hole principle there must be at least one category - or value of the difference - which contains 3 number pairs.</p>
