<h1>Problem ID 58097</h1>
<p>
  Several circles, whose total length of circumferences is 10, are placed inside a square of side 1. Prove that there will always be some straight line that crosses at least four of the circles.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Project all of the given circles onto the side $AB$ of the square $ABCD$. The projection of a circle of circumference $l$ is a line segment of length $ \frac {l}{\pi}$ - the diameter of the circle. Therefore the sum of all of the projections, or line segments, of the circles is equal to $ \frac {10}{\pi} > 3$.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore the line $AB$ contains a point which lies on the projection of at least 4 circles. Therefore a perpendicular to $AB$ drawn through this point will cross at least 4 circles, as required.
