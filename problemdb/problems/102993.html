<h1>Problem ID 102993</h1>
<p>
 There are some incorrect weighing scales, a bag of cereal and a correct weight of 1 kg. How can you weigh on these scales 1 kg of cereals?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Try to put on one cup of weights a weight of 1 kg and balance the scales.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
You can do this, for example by putting a weight of 1 kg on one cup of the scales and balancing the scales with a bag of anything. Now we will remove this weight from the scales and fill it with cereal instead. When there is exactly 1kg of cereal kg, the balance will be in equilibrium.
