<h1>Problem ID 87936</h1>
<p>
The grandad is twice as strong as the grandma, the grandma is three times stronger than the granddaughter, the granddaughter is four times stronger than the dog, the dog is five times stronger than the cat and the cat is six times stronger than the mouse. The grandad, the grandma, the granddaughter, the dog and the cat together with the mouse can pull out the pumpkin from the ground, which they cannot do without the mouse. How many mice should be summoned so that they can pull out the pumpkin themselves?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
How many mice are replaced by a cat? And the granddaughter?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The cat replaces 6 mice. The dog replaces $5 \times 6$ mice. The granddaughter replaces $4 \times 5 \times 6$ mice. The grandma replaces $3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6$ mice. The grandad replaces $2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6$ mice. The total number of mice required is:
<p>
$(2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6)$ + $(3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6)$ + $(4 \times 5 \times 6)$ + $(5 \times 6)$ + 6 + 1 = 1237 mice.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	1237 mice.
