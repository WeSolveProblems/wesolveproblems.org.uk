<h1>Problem ID 56562</h1>
<p>
Two circles intersect at the points P and Q. Through the point A of the first circle, the lines AP and AQ are drawn intersecting the second circle at points B and C. Prove that the tangent at point A to the first circle is parallel to the line BC.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let l be the tangent at the point A to the first circle. Then $\angle$($l, AP$)$ = $\angle$($AQ, PQ$)$ = $\angle$($BC, PB$)$, which means that l || BC.
</p>
