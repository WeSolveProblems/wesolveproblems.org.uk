<h1>Problem ID 60866</h1>
<p>
A square grid on the plane and a triangle with vertices at the nodes of the grid are given. Prove that the tangent of any angle in the triangle is a rational number.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The tangent of the angle between the side of the triangle and any of the coordinate axes is rational. The angles of a triangle are the sums or differences of such angles and, consequently, also have rational tangents.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
