<h1>Problem ID 65313</h1>
<p>
In the city where the Scattered Scientist lives, telephone numbers consist of 7 digits. The scientist easily remembers a phone number, if this number is a palindrome, that is, it is identical when read from left to right and from right to left. For example, the number 4435344 the scientist remembers easily, because this number is a palindrome. And the number 3723627 is not a palindrome, so the scientist does not remember this number easily. Find the probability that the scientist will remember the phone number of a new random acquaintance easily.

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
As you know, not every integer can be the first digit of a phone number. Let the number of allowed first digits be m. Then the total number of possible phone numbers is $m \times 10^6$. An easy number $($one that is remembered easily$)$ is uniquely determined by the first four digits. Hence, there are only $m times 10^3$ seven-valued palindromes. Therefore, the probability that an accidentally chosen number will be easy to remember is
