<h1>Problem ID 109997</h1>
<p>
On a function f $(x)$ defined on the whole line of real numbers, it is known that for any a $>$ 1 the function f $(x)$ + f $(ax)$ is continuous on the whole line. Prove that f $(x)$ is also continuous on the whole line.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We use the following properties of continuous functions:
<p>
$(i)$ the sum and difference of continuous functions are continuous functions;
<p>
$(ii)$ if g $(x)$ is a continuous function, the function g $(ax)$ is also continuous.
<p>
Now note that the functions f $(x)$ + f $(2x)$ and f $(x)$ + f $(4x)$ are continuous by the condition, and with regards to $(ii)$, the function f $(x)$ + f $(2x)$, together with the function f $(2x)$ + f $(4x)$ is also continuous. Furthermore, by property $(i)$, the function
$(f (x) + f (2x)) + (f (x) + f (4x)) - (f (2x) + f (4x))$ = 2f $(x)$,
is continuous 
and, hence, so is the function f $(x)$.
