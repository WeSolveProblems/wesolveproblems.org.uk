<h1>Problem ID 109877</h1>
<p>
A regular hexagon with sides of length 5 is divided by straight lines, that are parallel to its sides, to form regular triangles with sides of length 1 $($see the figure$)$.
</p>

</p>
We call the vertices of all such triangles, nodes. It is known that more than half of the nodes are marked. Prove that there are five marked nodes lying on one circumference.

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The total number of nodes is $2 \times (6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)$ = 91. Each node, with the exception of the central node, belongs to one of 11 concentric circles centred at the centre of the hexagon $($see the figure$)$.

Suppose that there are no five marked nodes lying on the same circumference. Then the total number of marked nodes is not more than $11 \times 4$ + 1 = 45, that is, not more than half. This is a contradiction.
