<h1>Problem ID 35429</h1>
<p>
There are two stacks of coins on a table: in one of them there are 30 coins, and in the other - 20. You can take any number of coins from one stack per move. The player who cannot make a move is the one that loses. Which player wins with the correct strategy?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Reduce the question to the ability to make a symmetrical move.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The first player wins. With the first move he makes the stacks equal, 20 coins each, and then no matter how the second player goes, the first has the opportunity to take the same amount of coins from the other pile $($there is the possibility to make symmetrical moves$)$

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
With the correct strategy, the first player will win.
