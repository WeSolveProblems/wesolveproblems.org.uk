<h1>Problem ID 87949</h1>
<p>
Two people had two square cakes. Each person made 2 straight cuts from edge to edge on their cake. After doing this, one person ended up with three pieces, and the other with four. How could this be?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note: the cuts may overlap.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
This could have happened if in the first case the cuts did not intersect each other, and in the second case they crossed. For example, if in the first case the cuts were parallel to each other, and in the second - perpendicular.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
In the first case, the cuts were parallel to each other, in the second they were perpendicular.
