<h1>Problem ID 35677</h1>
<p>
A city in the shape of a triangle is divided into 16 triangular blocks, at the intersection of any two streets is a square $($there are 15 squares in the city$)$. A tourist began to walk around the city from a certain square and travelled along some route to some other square, whilst visiting every square exactly once. Prove that in the process of travelling the tourist at least 4 times turned by 120$^{\circ}$.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Colour the blocks in black and white in an alternating order, like a chessboard. If the tourist passed two streets of one block, then he made a turn of 120$^{\circ}$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
The total area is equal to 15, therefore, the tourist passed through 14 streets connecting pairs of neighbouring squares. Colour the blocks in black and white in a chequered order. We end up with 10 black blocks, and each street is the boundary of exactly one black block. The tourist could not have passed through all three streets bordering the block. Hence, there are 14-10 = 4 black blocks, for which the tourist has walked on two streets. If the tourist has walked on two streets of one block, it is not difficult to see that he must have made a turn of 120$^{\circ}$ in one of the squares of this block. So, in no fewer than four black quarters, a turn of an angle of 120$^{\circ}$ is made.
