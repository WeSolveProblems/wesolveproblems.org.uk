<h1>Problem ID 88271</h1>
<p>
Among 40 containers there are two containers of different shapes and two containers of different colours. Prove that among them there are two containers that are both of different shapes and colours.
</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
Try to consider two containers of different shapes.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Letâ€™s choose two containers of different shapes. If they differ in colour, the problem is solved. If they are the same colour, then we take any container that is not of the same colour. This third container will also not coincide with one of the other two containers in shape. These two containers $($the third one and the one that does not coincide with it in shape$)$ will be the desired containers.
