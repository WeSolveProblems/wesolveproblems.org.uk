<h1>Problem ID 30432</h1>
<p>
a)	A piece of wire that is 120 cm long is given. Is it possible, without breaking the wire, to make a cube frame with sides of 10 cm?
<p>
b) What is the smallest number of times it will be necessary to break the wire in order to still produce the required frame?
</p>



<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a)	If it was possible, then the wire would go along the edges of the cube without overlapping, that is, we would draw the cube frame without taking the pencil off the paper. But this is impossible, since the cube has eight odd vertices.
<p>
  b) Since there are eight odd vertices, then one needs at least four such pieces.
  Four pieces are enough: for example, in a cube ABCDA'B'C'Dâ€™ the broken wire can cover the edges ABCDAA'B'C'D'A'. The remaining three edges BB ', CC', DD' will be covered by three separate pieces of wire.
</p>



<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
a)	It is impossible; b) three times.
