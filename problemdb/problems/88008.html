<h1>Problem ID 88008</h1>
<p>
In an apartment building in which there are only married couples with children, a population census was carried out. The person who conducted the census stated in the report: "There are more adults in the building than children. Each boy has a sister and there are more boys than girls. There are no childless families." This report was incorrect. Why?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
From the report, it follows that in every family there must be a girl. Why?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Each family must have a girl, since if there is a boy in the family, then according to the report he must have a sister, and if there is no boy in the family there must be a girl, since there are no childless families. This means that the number of girls is not less than the number of families. And since there are more boys than girls, there are more children than double the number of families, i.e. more than the number of adults. But in the report, it was written that there are more adults than children. This means that there is an error in the report.
