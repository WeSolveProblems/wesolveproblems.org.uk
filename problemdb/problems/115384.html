<h1>Problem ID 115384</h1>
<p>
  A game of 'Battleships' has a fleet comprising of one 1x4 square, two 1x3 squares, three 1x2 squares, and four 1x1 squares. It is easy to distribute the fleet of ships on a 10x10 board, see the example below. What is the smallest square board on which this fleet can be placed? Note that by the rules of the game, no two ships can be placed on horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent squares.

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  An example of an arrangement of this fleet on a 7x7 board is shown below. It remains to prove that no such arrangement is possible on a 6x6 board.

<p>
  Let us count not the squares, but the corners of squares taken up by a ship. A 1x4 ship takes up $2 \times 5=10$ corners, a 1x3 ship - 6 corners, and a 1x1 ship - 4 corners. By the rules of the game no corner of any square can be occupied by more than one ship. Therefore all of the ships take up $10+ 2 \times 8 + 3 \times 6 +4 \times 4= 60$ corners, and placing all of the ships on a board with fewer corners is impossible.
  </p>
  <p>
  However a 6x6 board contains just $ (6+1)^2=49 < 60$ corners.

<p>
  The same idea can be expressed slightly differently. Surround each ship in a rectangle, with dimensions half a square larger than the ship itself in each direction - see diagram below. These rectangles cannot touch and they occupy a total of $10+ 2 \times 8 + 3 \times 6 +4 \times 4= 60$ squares. If it is possible to place all of the ships on a 6x6 board then it would have to be possible to place all of the corresponding rectangles on a 7x7 board which contains just $49< 60$ squares.
</p>
<p>
  Note that each square of the new board for the rectangles corresponds exactly to a corner of the original board in the first version, which is why the calculations turn out exactly the same.
</p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p>
  Divide the 6x6 board into nine 2x2 squares. Each such square, upon placement of the ships, can contain marked squares belonging to only one ship. However there are 10 ships in total, therefore they cannot be placed on a board this size. Note that this line of reasoning proves that all 10 ships cannot be placed on a 6x6 board even if they are all of size 1x1.
