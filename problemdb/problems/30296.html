<h1>Problem ID 30296</h1>
<p>
In each cell of a $25 \times 25$ square table, one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 25 is written.
In cells, that are symmetric relative to the main diagonal, equal numbers are written.
There are no two equal numbers in any row and in any column.
Prove that the numbers on the main diagonal are pairwise distinct.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since there are no two equal numbers in any column, then there is an equal number of all numbers, that is, each number from 1 to 25 is repeated 25 times. 
Since there are 25 1s, there must be at least one 1 on the main diagonal. Similarly, on the main diagonal there is a two, a three, etc.
