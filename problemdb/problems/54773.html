<h1>Problem ID 54773</h1>
<p>
  Ten straight lines are drawn through a point on a plane, after which the plane is cut along these straight lines into angles.
Prove that at least one of these angles is less than 20$^{\circ}$.

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
 Suppose that each of the angles obtained is not less than 20$^{\circ}$.

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Ten straight lines, drawn through one point, split the plane into 20 angles. If they are all not less than 20$^{\circ}$, then their sum is not less than
$20 \times 20$ $^{\circ}$  = 400$^{\circ}$ which is greater than 360$^{\circ}$. This is a contradiction.

</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
Compare with problem number 78475.
