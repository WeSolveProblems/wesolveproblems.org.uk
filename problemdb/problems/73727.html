<h1>Problem ID 73727</h1>
<p>
Out of the given numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000, find the largest number m that has this property: no matter which m of these numbers you delete, among the remaining 1000 - m numbers there are two, of which one is divisible by the other.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
If m $\geq$ 500, then by deleting the first m numbers $($from 1 to m$)$, we leave the numbers from m + 1 $\geq$ 501 to 1000, among which none obviously are divisible by the other $($all pairwise ratios are smaller than two$)$.
The number m = 499 has the desired property. Indeed, if we take 501 numbers from a set from 1 to 1000, then among them there are two, of which one is divisible by the other $($see problem 60299$)$.
</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
m = 499
