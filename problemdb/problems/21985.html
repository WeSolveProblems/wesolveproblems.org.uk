<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  The total age of a group of 7 people is 332 years. Prove that it is possible to choose three members of this group, so that the sum of their ages is no less than 142 years.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider all of the possible groups of three members. The sums of the ages of all of the possible groups  is $15 \times 332$ (as each member of the group occurs in $\frac{3}{7}$ of the 35 possible groups). Therefore there must be a group of three, whose combined age is no less than $\frac{15 \times 332}{35}$ which is greater than 142.
