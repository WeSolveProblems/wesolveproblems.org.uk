<h1>Problem ID 89934</h1>
<p>
  15 points are placed inside a $4 \times 4$ square. Prove that it is possible to cut a unit square out of the $4 \times 4$ square, that does not contain any points.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  Try splitting the original square into unit squares.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Divide the original square into 16 $1 \times 1$ squares. Amongst the 16 squares, there will always be at least one that does not contain a point (15 points cannot be placed into 16 different squares).
</p>
