<h1>Problem</h1>
A ckass contains 33 pupils, who have a combined age of 430 years. Prove that if we picked the 20 oldest pupils, they would have a combined age of no less than 260 years. (The age of any given pupil is a whole number)

<h1>Solution</h1>
The combined age of the 20 oldest pupils is no less than $ \frac{20}{33} \times 430 = 260.6$ years.
Note: It is clear from the solution that the fact that the pupils' ages are a whole number is irrelevant. However, if we take it into account, we can claim that the combined age of the older group is no less than 261 years. This claim is true, if for example one pupil is 14 years old, and the rest of the pupils are 13 years old - the combined age of the 20 'oldest' is 261.
