<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A supermarket received a delivery of 25 crates of apples of 3 different types (each crate contains only one type of apple). Prove that there are at least 9 crates of apples of the same sort in the delivery.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If there were at most 8 crates of the same type there would need to be at most 24 crates, however there are 25, so by the Pigeon Hole Principle there must be one type of which there are 9 crates.
</p>
