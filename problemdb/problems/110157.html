<h1>Problem ID 110157</h1>
<p>
<p>
The circles $σ_1$ and $σ_2$ intersect at points A and B. At the point A to $σ_1$ and $σ_2$, respectively, the tangents $l_1$ and $l_2$ are drawn. The points $T_1$ and $T_2$ are chosen respectively on the circles $σ_1$ and $σ_2$ so that the angular measures of the arcs $T_1A$ and $AT_2$ are equal $($the arc value of the circle is considered in the clockwise direction$)$. The tangent $t_1$ at the point $T_1$ to the circle $σ_1$ intersects $l_2$ at the point $M_1$. Similarly, the tangent $t_2$ at the point $T_2$ to the circle $σ_2$ intersects $l_1$ at the point $M_2$. Prove that the midpoints of the segments $M_1M_2$ are on the same line, independent of the positions of the points $T_1, T_2$.

We make a homothetic transformation with centre at point A and positive coefficient k, taking the circle $σ_1$ to the circle $σ_1'$ which is equal to $σ_2$.
Let us agree that the images of points and lines under this homothetic transformation are denoted by primes.
<p>
Let $B_1$ be the second $($different from A$)$ intersection point $σ_1'$ and $σ_2$.
The circles $σ _1'$ and $σ_2$ are symmetric with respect to the line $AB_1$, and at this symmetry, $T_1'$ passes to $T_2, t_1'$ passes to $t_2$, and $M_1'$ passes to $M_2$. Thus, $AM_2 = AM_1 '= kAM_1$ $($k does not depend on the position of the points T_1 and T_2$)$.
<p>
Then all of the triangles $AM_1M_2$ are homothetic with centre A $($since points $M_1$ and $M_2$ lie on the lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ passing through A, on opposite sides of the line $AB_1$, and the ratio $AM_2: AM_1$ is constant$)$.
Hence it follows that the midpoints of the segments $M_1M_2$ lie on a fixed line passing through the point A.
