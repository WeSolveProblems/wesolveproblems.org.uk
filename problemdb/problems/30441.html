<h1>Problem ID 30441</h1>
<p>
Two people take turns placing bishops on a chessboard such that the bishops cannot attack each other. Here, the colour of the bishops does not matter. (Note: bishops move and attack diagonally.) Which player wins the game, if the right strategy is used?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The solution is easy to find by using the axial symmetry of a chessboard. The axis of symmetry can be taken as the straight line dividing the fourth and fifth horizontals (or rows). The parts of the board divided by this line are symmetrical but the mirror images have different coloured squares. Thus the bishop, when placed on the square which is the mirror image of the square that the other bishop is on, cannot impede the move of the next player. Therefore the second player wins this game.
