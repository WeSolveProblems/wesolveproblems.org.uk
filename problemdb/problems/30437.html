<h1>Problem ID 30437</h1>
<p>
On a board there are written 10 units and 10 deuces. During a game, one is allowed to erase any two numbers and, if they are the same, write a deuce, and if they are different then they can write a one. If the last digit left on the board is a unit, then the first player won, if it is a deuce then the second player wins.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The parity of the number of units on the board after each move does not change. Since there was at first an even number of units, after the last move on the board there can not be only one unit $($odd number!$)$. Therefore, the second player wins.
