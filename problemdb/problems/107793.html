<h1>Problem ID 107793</h1>
<p>
Cut the interval [-1, 1] into black and white segments so that the integrals of any a$)$ linear function; b$)$ a square trinomial in white and black segments are equal.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Since the integral of a polynomial over a segment is equal to the increment of its antiderivative, our problem is a particular case of problem number 98268.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
For example, a$)$ the segments [-1, -1], [1, 1] are black, [-1, 1] are white.
b$)$ the segments [-1, - 2], [- 0, 0], [0, 2] are white, [- 2, - 0], [0, 0], [2, 1] are black.
