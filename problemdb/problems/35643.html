<h1>Problem ID 35643</h1>
<p>
Prove that for every convex polyhedron there are two faces with the same number of sides.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose that any two faces of a convex polyhedron have a different number of sides. Letâ€™s consider the face G, which has the greatest number of sides; let it be equal to m. Consequently, the number of sides of any of the other faces is strictly less than m. Hence, the number of remaining faces is strictly less than m $($even if there were 1-angled and 2-angled shapes, we could only get m-1 different polygons$)$. On the other hand, exactly m other faces of the polyhedron adjoin the face G $($one side to each side$)$. We have found a contradiction. Therefore, two faces have to have an equal number of sides.
