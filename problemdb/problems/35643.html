<h1>Problem ID 35643</h1>
<p>
2001 vertices of a regular 5000-gon are painted. Prove that there are three coloured vertices lying on the vertices of an isosceles triangle.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
If three vertices of a regular pentagon are painted, then they lie on the vertices of an isosceles triangle.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>

Letâ€™s split all of the vertices of the regular 5000-gon into 1000 groups of five vertices, located on 999 consecutive vertices. The points in each group are the vertices of a regular pentagon. There are 2001 = $2 \times 1000$ + 1 painted vertices, therefore, at least three vertices are coloured in a certain group. But every three vertices of a regular pentagon lie at the vertices of an isosceles triangle.
</p>
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>

Compare with problem number 35758.
