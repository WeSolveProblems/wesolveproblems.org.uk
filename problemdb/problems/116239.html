<h1>Problem ID 116239</h1>
<p>
There are 40 weights of weights of 1 g, 2 g, ..., 40 grams. Of these, 10 weights of even weight were chosen and placed on the left hand side of the scales. Then we selected 10 weights of odd weight and put it on the right hand side of the scales. The scales were balanced. Prove that on one of the bowls of the scales there are two weights with a mass difference of 20 g.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We divide the weights into pairs with a difference of 20 g: $(1, 21)$, $(2, 22)$, ..., $(20, 40)$. If there is exactly one weight from each pair on the scales, then $($ regardless of the choice of weights in the pairs $)$ the weight of one on the odd cup is comparable to zero modulo 20, and the weight of one on the even one is equal to 10 modulo 20. This gives us a contradiction.
