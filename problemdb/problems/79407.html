<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  A square $ABCD$ contains 5 points. Prove that the distance between some pair of these points does not exceed $ \frac{1}{2} AC$
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  By drawing lines through the centre of the square, parallel to its sides, we can divide the square into 4 parts. Some two of these 4 points lie in the same one of these 4 parts, and the distance between them cannot exceed the length of the diagonal of this quarter of the square (which is equal to $ \frac{1}{2} AC$ ).
