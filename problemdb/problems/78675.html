<h1>Problem ID 78675</h1>
<p>
Two lines on the plane intersect at an angle $ \alpha $. On one of them there is a flea. Every second it jumps from one line to the other $($the point of intersection is considered to belong to both straight lines$)$. It is known that the length of each of her jumps is 1 and that she never returns to the place where she was a second ago. After some time, the flea returned to its original point. Prove that the angle $ \alpha $ is measured by a rational number of degrees.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
For each jump vector there are exactly two positions of the flea, for which the jump is given by this vector. Therefore, the sequence of jumps is periodic if and only if there are only a finite number of different hopping vectors. Let $ \vec {a} _ {1} $ be the vector of a flea jump from the line $l_2$ to the line $l_1$; $ \vec {a} _ {2} $, $ \vec {a} _ {3} $, $ \vec {a} _ {4} $, ... are the vectors of the subsequent jumps. Then $\vec {a} _ {2} $ = $S_l_2 (\vec {a} _ {1} ), \vec {a} _ {3}  = S_l_1 (\vec {a} _ { 2} ), \vec {a} _ {4} = S_l2 ( \vec {a} _ {3} )$, ... Since the composition $S_l_1oS_l_2$ is a rotation through an angle of 2 $ \alpha $ $($or by the angle 2 $ \pi $ - 2 $ \alpha $), the vectors $ \vec {a} _ {3} $, $ \vec {a} _ {5} $, $ \vec {a} _ {7} $, ... are obtained from the vector $ \vec {a} _ {1} $ by rotations on 2 $ \alpha $, 4 $ \alpha $, 6 $ \alpha $, ... $($or by 2 $( \pi  -\alpha), 4 ( \ pi -  \ alpha ), 6 ( \ pi  -  \ alpha)$, ...$)$. Therefore, the set $ \vec {a} _ {1} $, $ \vec {a} _ {3} $, $ \vec {a} _ {5} $, ... contains a finite number of distinct vectors if and only if when $ \alpha $ / $ \pi $ is a rational number. The set $ \vec {a} _ {2} $, $ \vec {a} _ {4} $, $ \vec {a} _ {6} $, ... is treated similarly.
