<h1>Problem ID 78494</h1>
<p>
All of the integers from 1 to 64 are written in an $8 \times 8$ table. Prove that in this case there are two adjacent numbers, the difference between which is not less than 5. $($Numbers that are in cells which share a common side are called adjacent$)$.
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Letâ€™s consider a horizontal row of the table containing the number 1 and a vertical column containing the number 64. We can move from the cell containing the number 1 to the cell containing the number 64 by going first along the row, and then along the column, and our path will consist of no more than 14 steps $($a step is defined as a transition from any cell to an adjacent one$)$.
Suppose that the difference between each two adjacent numbers in the table is less than 5. Then for the 14 steps or fewer, which occurred when moving from 1 to 64, no more than $14 \times 4$ = 56 can be added to the original number 1. Meanwhile, 64 - 1 = 63. This is a contradiction.
</p>
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
Compare with problem number 78501.
