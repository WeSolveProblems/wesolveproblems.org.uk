<h1>Problem ID 30442</h1>
<p>
There are two piles of rocks, each with 7 rocks. Consider the game with two players where: in one turn you can take any amount of rocks, but only from one pile. The loser is the one who has no rocks left to take.

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In this game the second player wins with the help of symmetric strategy: every time it is the second player's turn, they must take take the same amount of stones as the first player did in the previous turn, but from the other pile. In this way, the second player will always have rocks left to take.
