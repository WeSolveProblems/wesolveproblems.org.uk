<h1>Problem ID 56684</h1>
<p>
From a point A the tangents AB and AC are drawn to a circle with center O. Prove that if from the point M the segment AO is visible at an angle of 90$^{\circ}$, then the segments OB and OC are also visible from it at equal angles.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Points M, B and C lie on a circle with diameter AO. Furthermore, the chords OB and OC of this circle are then equal.
</p>
