<h1>Problem ID 65726</h1>
<p>
Author: A. Khrabrov
<p>
Do there exist integers a and b such that
<p>
  a) the equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ does not have roots, and the equation $[x^2] + ax + b = 0$ does have roots?
b)	the equation $x^2 + 2ax + b = 0$ does not have roots, and the equation $[x^2] + 2ax + b = 0$ does have roots?
<p>
Note that here, square brackets represent integers and curly brackets represent non-integer values or 0.


</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
a)	The equation $x^2 - 3x + 3 = 0$ has no roots, since it has a discriminant negative, and the equation $[x^2] - 3x + 3 = 0$ has the roots $x_1 = 4/3, x_2 = 5/3$.
<p>
b) Suppose that the function $f (x) = x^2 + 2ax = b = (x + a)^2 + b - a^2$ does not vanish, i.e. it is equal to 0. Then $b - a^2$ is positive, and therefore at least 1 $($a and b are integers$)$. Hence, $f (x) â‰¥ 1$ for any x. Replacing $x^2$ by an integer reduces the value of the function by less than 1, and therefore leaves it positive.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
a) Yes, there do exist; b) No, there do not.
