<h1>Problem ID 30424</h1>
<p>
John, coming back from Disneyland, told me that there are seven islands on the enchanted lake, each of which is lead to by one, three or five bridges. Is it true that at least one of these bridges necessarily leads to the shore of the lake?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If no bridge were to go to the shore, then in the corresponding graph there would be seven odd vertices, which contradicts problem number 87972 b).
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes, it is true.
