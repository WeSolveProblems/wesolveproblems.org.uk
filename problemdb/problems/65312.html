<h1>Problem ID 65312</h1>
<p>
In a numerical set there is 100 numbers. If you remove one number, the median of the remaining numbers will be 78. If you remove a different number, the median of the remaining numbers is 66. Find the median of the entire set.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Arrange the numbers in ascending order. If you remove the number from the first half of the series $($with the number up to 50$)$, then the median of the remaining numbers will be the 51st number of the series. If you remove the number from the second half, the median of the remaining numbers will be the 50th number in the series, but it is not greater than the 51st number. Thus, the 50th number is 66, and the 51st number is 78. Hence, the median of the whole set is $($66 + 78$)$/ 2 = 72.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
72.
