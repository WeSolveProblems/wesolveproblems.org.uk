<h1>Problem ID 65204</h1>
<p>
  A unit square is divided into $n$ triangles. Prove that one of the triangles can be used to completely cover a square with side length $\frac{1}{n}$.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  For $n=24 and $n=3$ the statement made by the problem can be checked directly, see the diagrams below.

<p>
  Let $n \geq 4$. The sum of the areas of the $n$ triangles into which the unit square is divided must equal 1, therefore amongst them there will be a triangle with area $S \geq \frac{1}{n}$.
</p>
<p>
  We shall prove that this triangle can be used to cover a square with side $ \frac{1}{n}$.
</p>
<p>
  Let $a$ be the length of the largest side of the chosen triangle, and $h$ the height of the triangle with respect to that side.
</p>
<p>
  Consider a square, one of whose sides lies on side $a$ of the triangle and two of whose other vertices just touch the other two sides of the triangle, see the diagram.
</p>
<p>
  The opposite side of the square defines another triangle which is similar to the first one, with scale factor $h= \frac{h}{a} = \frac{h-x}{h}$ where $x$ is equal to the side length of the square. Re-arranging this gives $x= \frac{ab}{a+h}$
</p>

<p>
  If $a+h \leq 2$ then by virtue of the inequality $S = \frac{ah}{2} \geq \frac{1}{n}$ we get $x \geq \frac{2}{n} \times \frac{1}{a+h} \geq \frac{1}{n}$.
</p>
<p>
  If in fact $a+h > 2$ then $h > 2-a \geq 2- \sqrt{2}$ since $a \leq \sqrt{2} as the side of the triangle cannot exceed the length of the diagonal of the unit square. Furthermore, $a \geq h$. In fact if $b$ is one of the other sides of the triangle, then $ a \geq b \geq h$. Using these inequalities we get:
</p>
$$ x= \frac{h}{\frac{h}{a}+1} \geq \frac{h}{2} \geq \frac{2-\sqrt{2}}{2} > \frac{1}{4} \geq \frac{1}{n}$$
