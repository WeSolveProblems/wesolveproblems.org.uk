<h1>Problem ID 30467</h1>
<p>
The game begins with the number 0. In one go, it is allowed to add to the actual number any natural number from 1 to 9. The winner is the one who gets the number 100.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
This problem is an example of the fact that a geometric interpretation is not necessary for the analysis from the end. Here the pluses and minuses are convenient to mark numbers. The numbers that are divisible by 10 are marked by pluses. Thus, the second player wins.
