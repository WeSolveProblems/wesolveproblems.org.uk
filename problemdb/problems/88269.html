<h1>Problem ID 88269</h1>
<p>
At the cat show, 10 male cats and 19 female cats sit in a row where next to each female cat sits a fatter male cat. Prove that next to each male cat is a female cat, which is thinner than it.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We will draw an arrow to each female cat from the male cat sitting next to her, which is fatter than she is. Then, the number of arrows is 19: the same as the number of cats. But, on the other hand, no more than two arrows can leave from each male cat since the arrows point to neighbouring cats, and yet, they do not point to all of the female cats, but only to the thinner ones. Consequently, the arrows lead from all male cats, as required.


</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
