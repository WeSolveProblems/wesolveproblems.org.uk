<h1>Problem ID 97817</h1>
<p>
$a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, ... is an increasing sequence of natural numbers. It is known that $a_{a_k}$ = 3k for any k. Find a$)$ $a_{100}$; b$)$ $a_{1983}$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>    
a$)$ We note immediately that the sequence $a_k$ is strictly increasing. Indeed, the assumption $a_k$ = $a_{k + 1}$ = n immediately leads to a contradiction: $a_n$ = 3k = 3 $(k + 1)$.    In addition, $a_1$ $>$ 1 $($otherwise $a_{a_1}$ = $a_1$ = 1 â‰  3$)$. It follows that $a_k$ $>$ k for all k. On the other hand, $a_1$ $<$ $a_{a_1}$ = 3. Therefore, $a_1$ = 2, $a_2$ = 3, $a_3$ = 6, $a_6$ = 9, $a_9$ = 18, $a_{18}$ = 27, $a_{27}$ = 54, $a_{54}$ = 81, $a_{81}$ = 162, $a_{162}$ = 243. And since 162 - 81 = 243 - 162, then $a_k$ = 81 + k for all k from 81 to 162. In particular, $a_{100}$ = 181.   
<p>
b$)$ $a_{162}$ = 243, $a_{243}$ = 486, $a_{486}$ = 729. Since 729-486 = 486 - 243, then $a_k$ = 243 + k for all k from 243 to 486. In particular, $a_{418}$ = 661, which means that $a_{661}$ = 1254, $a_{1254}$ = 1983, $a_{1983}$ = 3762.
