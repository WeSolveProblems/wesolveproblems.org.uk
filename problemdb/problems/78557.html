<h1>Problem ID 78496</h1>
<p>
What is the largest amount of numbers that can be selected from the set 1, 2, ..., 1963 so that the sum of any two numbers is not divisible by their difference?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
We show first that from the given set, you can select the 655 numbers that fit the required condition. In fact, we take all numbers of the form 3k + 1; k = 0, 1, ..., 654. The difference of any two such numbers is obviously divisible by 3, while the sum of any two of them gives the remainder 2 when divided by 3. It follows that the sum of any two chosen numbers is not divisible into their difference, that is, the correct ones were chosen. We now show that no more numbers can be chosen which satisfy conditions of the problem. Indeed, if we chose more than 655 numbers, we would find two numbers that differ from each other by less than 3 $($otherwise the difference between the largest and smallest numbers of the given set would be greater than $3\times654$ = 1962, which is impossible$)$. So, there must be two numbers that differ from each other by 1 or 2. In the first case, the difference between them is 1, and everything, including their sum, is divisible by 1. In the second case, the difference between the chosen numbers is 2, and so both of these numbers have the same parity, which means that their sum is an even number. And in this case the sum of the numbers taken is divisible by their difference. We showed that from this set it is impossible to select more than 655 numbers so that the conditions of the problem are fulfilled, and so we have constructed an example of how you can select 655 numbers. Therefore, the largest amount of numbers that can be selected from this set in accordance with the conditions of the task is 655.
