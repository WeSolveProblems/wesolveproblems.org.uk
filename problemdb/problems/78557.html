<h1>Problem ID 78557</h1>
<p>
Several pieces of carpet are laid along a corridor. Pieces cover the entire corridor from end to end without omissions and even overlap one another, so that over some parts of the floor lie several layers of carpet. Prove that you can remove a few pieces, perhaps by taking them out from under others and leaving the rest exactly in the same places they used to be, so that the corridor will still be completely covered and the total length of the pieces left will be less than twice the length corridor.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Choose out of all the pieces of the carpet that cover the left end of the corridor, the one with the right end that lies furthest to the right and denote this piece as $I_1$. After selecting a piece of $I_k$, choose out of all the pieces covering its right end, the one whose right end lies furthest to the right. Thus, we select several pieces completely covering the corridor. It remains to prove that the sum of their lengths does not exceed 2. The piece $I_{k + 2}$ has no points in common with $I_k$, since otherwise we would have to choose $I_{k + 2}$ instead of $I_{k + 1}$. Therefore, each point of the corridor of length 1 is covered by at most two pieces $I_k$, that is, the sum of the lengths of these pieces does not exceed 2.
