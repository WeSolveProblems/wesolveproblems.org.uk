<h1>Problem ID 35758</h1>
<p>
  All the points on the edge of a circle are coloured in two different colours at random. Prove that there will be an equilateral triangle with vertices of the same colour inside the circle - the vertices are points on the circumference of the circle.
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  In a regular pentagon any group of three vertices describes an equilateral triangle.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider a regular pentagon that just fits into the circle. Of its 5 vertices, at least 3 will be the same colour. These three vertices represent the three points that can form an equilateral triangle with vertices of the same colour.
