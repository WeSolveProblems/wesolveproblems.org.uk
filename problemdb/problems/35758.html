<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  All the points on the edge of a circle are coloured in at random in two different colours. Prove that there will be an equilateral triangle with vertices of the same colour inside the circle (the vertices are points on the circumference of the circle).
</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
  In a regular pentagon any group of three vertices descrives an equilateral triangle.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider a regular pentagon that just fits into the circle. Of its 5 vertices, at least 3 will be the same colour. These three vertices represent the three points that can form an equilateral triangle with vertices of the same colour.
