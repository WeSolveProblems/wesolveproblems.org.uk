<h1>Problem ID 65768</h1>
<p>
For the anniversary of the London Mathematical Olympiad, the mint coined three commemorative coins. One coin turned out correctly, the second coin on both sides had two heads, and the third had tails on both sides. The director of the mint, without looking, chose one of these three coins and tossed it at random. She got heads. What is the probability that the second side of this coin also has heads? 

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
It is known that the coin showed heads. So, either the first coin or the second one was chosen. In total, these coins depict tails three times. In one of these three equally possible cases, tails is on the opposite side of the coin, and in the other two cases the coin has heads.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
2/3.
