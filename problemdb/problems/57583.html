<h1>Problem ID 57583</h1>
<p>
The point D lies on the base AC of the isosceles triangle ABC. Prove that the radii of the circumscribed circles of the triangles ABD and CBD are equal.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The radii of the circumscribed circles of the triangles ABD and CBD are equal to AB / 2 sin ADB and BC / 2 sin BDC. It remains to note that AB = BC and sin ADB = sin BDC.
