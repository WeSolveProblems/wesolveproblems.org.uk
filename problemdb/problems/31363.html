<h1>Problem ID 31363</h1>
<p>
  a) In a group of 4 people, who speak different languages, any three of them can communicate with one another; perhaps by one translating for two others. Prove that it is always possible to split them into pairs so that the two members of every pair have a common language.
</p>
<p>
  b) The same, but for a group of 100 people.
</p>
<p>
  c) The same, but for a group of 102 people.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  a) Consider a graph with 4 vertices $A, B, C, D$ that corresponds to people, and edges connecting them that correspond to a common language. The conditions given mean that any three vertices are connected by at least two edges. It remains to prove that there are two edges that do not share a vertex; assume this is not true.
</p>
<p>
  Scenario 1: If in the group of 3 $(A, B, C)$ the edges $AB$ and $AC$ are present then the edges $BD$ and $CD$ do not exist. But then the group of 3 $(B, C, D)$ would not have a shared vertex. This is a contradiction.
</p>
<p>
  Scenario 2: There are a total of 4 possible groups of 3. Each edge connects two of these groups. Therefore there are no fewer than $4 \times 2 \div 2=4$. On the other hand, each edge must have a corresponding 'missing' edge. Therefore there are no more than 3 edges. This is a contradiction.
</p>
<p>
  c) Take two people, who have a common language. Divide the remaining 100 people, as in part b$)$ into groups of 4. From a) we get that it is possible to split every group of 4 into two pairs with a common language.
