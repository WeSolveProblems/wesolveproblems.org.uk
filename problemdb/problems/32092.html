<h1>Problem ID 32092</h1>
<p>
In each square of a rectangular table of size $M \times K$, a number is written. The sum of the numbers in each row and in each column, is 1. Prove that M = K.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We find the sum of all the numbers of the table in two ways. Since the table contains M rows and the sum of the numbers of each row is 1, the whole sum is M. Similarly, considering the same sum over the columns, we get the result of K.
