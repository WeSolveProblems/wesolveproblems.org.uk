<h1>Problem ID 34991</h1>
<p>
 On a line, there are 50 segments. Prove that either it is possible to find some 8 segments all of which have a shared intersection, or there can be found 8 segments, no two of which intersect.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Choose the segment with the smallest right end, then choose the segment with the smallest right end out of the segments that does not intersect with the first segment, etc.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Let [$a_1, b_1$] be the segment with the smallest right end. If the number of segments containing the point b1 is greater than 7, then the problem is solved. If it is less than or equal to 7, then there are at least 50-7 = 43 segments lying to the right of b1. We choose from them the segment [$a_2, b_2$] the point with the smallest right end. Then either b2 belongs to 8 segments, or there are 50 - $2 \times 7$ = 36 segments lying to the right of b2. Continuing on and on, we can either find a point belonging to 8 segments, or we obtain 7 pairwise non-intersecting segments [$a_1, b_1$], [$a_2, b_2$], ..., [$a_7, b_7$] such that bk belongs to 50 -7k segments, i.e. to the right of b7 lies another segment [$a_8, b_8$]. In this case we obtain a system of 8 pairwise non-intersecting segments [$a_1, b_1$], [$a_2, b_2$], ..., [$a_8, b_8$].
