<h1>Problem ID 89924</h1>
<p>
In a race between 6 athletes, Andrew falls behind Boris and two athletes finish between them. Vincent finished after Declan, but before George. Declan finished before Boris but after Eric. Which order did the athletes finish the race in?

</p>



<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Could Andrew have been first?


</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let us refer to the athletes by the first letter of their names. From the second condition we have that: V, D and G finished in the order D, V, G (not necessarily right after each other). From the third condition: D, B, E finished in the order E, D, B. Since (from the first condition) between B and A there are two athletes, so the order of finishing is: E, D, B, two athletes, A. Then it is easy to determine the order: E - first, D - second, B - third, V - fourth, G - fifth, A - sixth.
