<h1>Problem ID 65697</h1>
<p>
There are 23 students in a class. During the year, each student of this class celebrated their birthday once, which was attended by some $($ at least one, but not all $)$ of their classmates. Could it happen that every two pupils of this class met each other the same number of times at such celebrations? $($ It is believed that at every party every two guests met, and also the birthday person met all the guests. $)$

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We give examples of how this could happen.
The first example. We will arrange the pupils in a circle. Suppose that everyone on their birthday went up to all the classmates, except the one following him clockwise. Then every two pupils A and B met at all of the parties, except for two: the one that A did not attend, and the one that B did not attend. Hence, each pair of pupils met 21 times.
The second example. Let's select from the class two pupils A and B. Let on A's birthday all classmates came to the celebration, except for B, and to the birthday party of B only A came, and to the remaining birthdays came only B. Then every couple in which there is no B met only on the birthday of A, and all the pairs containing B, met exactly once in the other celebrations. Therefore in total, each pair met exactly once.
