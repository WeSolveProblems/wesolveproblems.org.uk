<h1>Problem ID 88078</h1>
<p>
Before the start of the Olympics, the price of hockey pucks went up by 10%, and after the end of the Olympics they fell by 10%.
When were the pucks more expensive â€“ before the price rise or after the fall? 
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
$0.9 \times 1.1$ = 0.99. So, before the price went up, the pucks were more expensive.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>

Before the rise in price.
