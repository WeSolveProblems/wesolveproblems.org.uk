<h1>Problem ID 98187</h1>
<p>
Initially, a natural number A is written on a board. You are allowed to add to it one of its divisors, distinct from itself and one. With the resulting number you are permitted to perform a similar operation, and so on.
Prove that from the number A = 4 one can, with the help of such operations, come to any given in advance composite number.
  
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
To the number 4 you can add the number 2 many times, so that you can create all possible even numbers.
Let it be necessary to obtain an odd compound number mn, where m $>$ 2, n $>$ 2. First, we get the number 2m. Next we add to it the divisor m until we get the number mn.
