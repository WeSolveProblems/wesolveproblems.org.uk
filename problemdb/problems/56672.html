<h1>Problem ID 56672</h1>
<p>
Two circles touch at a point A. A common $($outer$)$ tangent touching the circles at points C and B is drawn. Prove that $\angle$CAB = 90$^{\circ}$.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let M be the point of intersection of the line CB and the tangent to the circles at the point A. Then MC = MA = MB $($the equality of tangent segments$)$. Therefore, point A lies on a circle with diameter CB.
