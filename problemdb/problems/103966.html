<h1>Problem ID 103966</h1> <p>
In Mongolia there are in circulation coins of 3 and 5 tugriks. An entrance ticket to the central park costs 4 tugriks. One day before the opening of the park, a line of 200 visitors queued up in front of the ticket booth. Each of them, as well as the cashier, has exactly 22 tugriks. Prove that all of the visitors will be able to buy a ticket in the order of the queue.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
There is only one way to collect 22 tugriks with 3 and 5 tugrik coins: two coins of 5 tugriks and four coins of 3 tugriks. Let's specify how the cashier should act. He asks for three coins for 3 tugriks from the first visitor and gives him the change in a coin of 5 tugriks. With the second visitor, the cashier asks for two coins of 5 tugriks and gives him change with two coins of 3 tugriks. After that, the cashier has one more coin of each type. Continuing to act in the same way, the cashier will be able to serve any number of visitors.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
