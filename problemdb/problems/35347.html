<h1>Problem ID 35347</h1>
<p>
In a basket there are 13 apples. There are scales, with which you can find out the total weight of any two apples. Think of a way to find out from 8 weighings the total weight of all the apples.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Try from three weighings to find the total weight of three apples.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We number the apples. We weigh the first apple with the second, the second with the third and the third with the first, then add the weights obtained $($somewhere in the notebook$)$ and get twice the weight of the three apples, and then we can calculate the weight of the three apples. Therefore, from the three weighings, we learned the total weight of the first three apples. There are five weighings and ten apples, which we weigh in pairs and, summing all the data, we get the weight of 13 apples.
