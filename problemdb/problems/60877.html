<h1>Problem ID 60877</h1>
<p>
Prove that if $($m, 10$)$ = 1, then there is a repeated unit $E_n$ that is divisible by m. Will there be infinitely many repeated units?
</p>

<h1>Solution 1</h1>
<p>
By the Euler theorem, $ 9E_{kφ (m)} $ = $10^{kφ (m)}$ -1 $\equiv$ 0$ $($mod m$)$$ for any k $\geq$ 1. If m is not divisible by 3, then $ E_{kφ (m)} $ \equiv $ 0 $ ($mod m$) $. If m is divisible by 3 or by 9, then the number $E_{9kφ (m)} $ can be divided by m.
</p>

<h1>Solution 2</h1>
<p>
See the solution to problem number 34968.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes, there will be.
