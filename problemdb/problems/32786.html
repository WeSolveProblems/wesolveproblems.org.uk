<h1>Problem ID 32786</h1>
<p>12 straight lines passing through the origin are drawn on a plane. Prove that it is possible to choose two of these lines such that the angle between them is less than 17 degrees.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Using proof by contradiction. Assume that the angle between any two lines is no less than 17 degrees. The given lines divide the plane into 24 angles, therefore their sum is no less than $24 \times 17 = 408$ degrees. However the sum of the angles around a point must equal 360 degrees. which is a contradiction. Therefore there exists two lines whereby the angle between them is less than 17 degrees.</p>
