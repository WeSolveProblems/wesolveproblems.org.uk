Each of them correctly distinguished some two colors, and confused the numbers of the other two colours: one mixed up the red and orange, another - orange and yellow, and the third - yellow and green. The results of their calculations are given in the table.
How many balls of each colour actually were there?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Errors in the calculation of red balls could only have been done by one of them, and the other two correctly counted the number of red balls. Therefore, there were 2 red balls. In the calculation of the red balls, C was mistaken, so he confused the red with the orange, and the yellow and green ones were correct. We get that there were then 8 yellow balls, and 9 green ones. All the remaining balls were orange. The total number of balls being considered was correct - 23. So, there were 4 orange balls.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Reds - 2, orange - 4, yellow - 8, green - 9.
