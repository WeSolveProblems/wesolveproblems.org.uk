<h1>Problem ID 87951</h1>
<p>
How can you divide a pancake with three straight sections into 4, 5, 6, 7 parts?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The number of parts depends on whether the cuts cross each other inside the pancake.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We draw in the pancake three straight lines and consider the points of their intersection. Depending on where these points are located, a specific number of parts will be obtained. To get 4 pieces, you need to place all three points outside the pancake $($Figure 1$)$. The transfer of one of these points from outside of the border of the pancake to the inside adds one part. So, to get 5 pieces, you have to transfer one point to the inside of the pancake $($Figure 2$)$, 6 - one more point needs to be moved inside the pancake $($Figure 3$)$, 7 - place all the three intersection points inside the pancake $($Figure 4$)$.
