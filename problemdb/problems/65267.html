<h1>Problem ID 65267</h1>
<p>
There are two symmetrical cubes. Is it possible to write some numbers on their faces so that the sum of the points when throwing these cubes on the upwards facing face on landing takes the values 1, 2, ..., 36 with equal probabilities?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Let us give an example of such cubes. Let the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 be written on the first die, and on the second 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30. Any number from 1 to 36 is uniquely represented as a sum of the numbers written on two cubes. Thus, the sum of the points after the throw takes the values 1, 2, ..., 36 with equal probabilities.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Yes, you can.
