<h1>Problem ID 116661</h1>
<p>
Can 100 weights of masses 1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100 be arranged into 10 piles of different masses so that the following condition is fulfilled: the heavier the pile, the fewer weights in it?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Suppose that we can arrange the weights in accordance with the condition of the problem. The sum of the masses of all of the weights is 5050. Hence, the mass of the heaviest pile is at least 5050 / 10 = 505. Since there are no weights of mass greater than 100, there are at least 6 weights in this pile. Hence, the total number of weights is not less than
6 + 7 + 8 + ... + 15 = 105 $>$ 100. This is a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>

No, they cannot.
