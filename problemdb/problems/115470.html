<h1>Problem ID 115470</h1>
<p>
  A class has 25 pupils. It is known that for any two girls in the class, the number of male friends they have in the class is different. What is the maximum number of girls that it is possible for there to be in the class?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If there are 13 girls in the class then the number of male friends they could have from that class can be any number from 0 to 12 (13 possibilities), which fits the conditions. If are more than 13 girls, for example 14, then there will be at most 11 boys in the class so the number of possible male friends would be no more than 12 (from 0 to 11). Therefore at least two girls will have the same number of male friends in the class, which is a contradiction.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
  13.
