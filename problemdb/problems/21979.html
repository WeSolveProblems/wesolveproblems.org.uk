<h1>Problem</h1>
a) What is the maximum number of squares on an 8x8 grid that can be shaded in with a black pen such that each 'L' shaped group of 3 squares has at least one unshaded square.
b) What is the maximum number of squares on an 8x8 grid that can be shaded in with a black pen, such that each 'L' shaped group of 3 squares has at least one shaded square.

<h1>Solution</h1>
a) For example 32 squares can be shaded in (for example in alternate rows). Divide the grid into 16 2x2 zones. In each zone we can shade in no more than two squares (otherwise we will have a completely shaded in 'L' shaped group of squares). Therefore in total we can shade in no more than 32 squares.
b) This problem reduces down to a) but with the shaded and unshaded squares reversed.
<h1>Answer</h1>
The maximum is 32 in both cases.
