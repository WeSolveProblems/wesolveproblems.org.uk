<h1>Problem ID 116581</h1>
<p>
At a round table, 30 people are sitting - knights and liars $($ knights always tell the truth, and liars always lie $)$. It is known that each of them at that table has exactly one friend, and for each knight this friend is a liar, and for a liar this friend is a knight $($ friendship is always mutual $)$. To the question "Does your friend sit next to you?" those in every other seat answered “yes”. How many of the others could also have said "Yes"?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
All those sitting at the table break up into pairs of friends; hence, there is an equal number of knights and liars. Consider any couple of friends. If they are sitting next to each other, then the knight will answer "Yes" to the question, and the liar says "No". If they do not sit side by side, their answers will be opposite. In any case, exactly one of a pair of friends will answer "Yes." Hence, all the remaining 15 answers will be "no".

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
0.
