<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Prove that it is not possible to completely cover an equilateral triangle with two smaller equilateral triangles.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Each of the smaller triangles cannot cover more than one corner of the larger triangle. Therefore one corner will always remain uncovered, so the larger triangle will not be completely covered. </p>
