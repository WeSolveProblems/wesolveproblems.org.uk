<h1>Problem ID 87266</h1>
Find the volume of an inclined triangular prism whose base is an equilateral triangle with sides equal to a if the side edge of the prism is equal to the side of the base and is inclined to the plane of the base at an angle of 60$^{\circ}$.
<p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let K be the orthogonal projection of the vertex A of the inclined prism $ABCA_1B_1C_1$ onto the plane of the base ABC, AB = BC = AC = $AA_1 = BB_1 = DD_1$ = a. By the condition of the problem $\angle $$AA_1K$ = 60$^{\circ}$
From the right triangle $AKA_1$ we find that
<p>
AK = $AA_1 \times \angle A_1K$ = $a \times sin 60^{\circ} = a \sqrt {3}$/2,
<p>
but because AK is the height of the prism $ABCA_1B_1C_1$, then
V$($ABCA_1B_1C_1$)$ = S $($ABC$)$ \times AK$ = $($a^2$\sqrt {3}$ /4$)$ \times $($a $\sqrt {3}$ /2$)$ = $3a^2$ /8.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
$3a^2$ /8.
