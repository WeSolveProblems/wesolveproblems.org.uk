<h1>Problem ID 36044</h1>
<p>
Two friends went simultaneously from A to B. The first went by bicycle, the second - by car at a speed five times faster than the first. Halfway along the route, the car was in an accident, and the rest of the way the motorist walked on foot at a speed half of the speed of the cyclist. Which of them arrived at B first?

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The cyclist moves twice as fast as the pedestrian, so he can travel all of the way in the time that the pedestrian will walk half of the route. But at the moment when the pedestrian sets out, the cyclist has already travelled a certain distance. So, the cyclist would arrive earlier.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	The cyclist.
