<h1>Problem ID 88229</h1>
<p>
Find a two-digit number that is 5 times the sum of its digits.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note: the required number must be divisible by 5.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
A number that is 5 times larger than the sum of its digits must be divisible by 5. This means it ends in 0 or 5. However, it cannot end on 0, because in this case it will be 10 times larger than the sum of its digits. So, the required number can be written in the form 10a + 5. The sum of the digits of this number is a + 5. Hence, we can form the equation
10a + 5 = 5 $($a + 5$)$.
Solving it, we get: a = 4, the desired number is 45.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
 45.
