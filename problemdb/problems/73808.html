<h1>Problem ID 73808</h1>
<p>
Author: V.A. Popov
<p>
On the interval [0; 1] a function f is given. This function is non-negative at all points, f $(1)$ = 1 and, finally, for any two non-negative numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ whose sum does not exceed 1, the quantity $f (x_1 + x_2)$ does not exceed the sum of $f (x_1)$ and $f (x_2 )$.
<p>
a)	Prove that for any number x on the interval [0; 1], the inequality $f (x_2) ≤ 2x$ holds.
<p>
b) Prove that for any number x on the interval [0; 1], the $f (x_2) ≤ 1.9x$ must be true?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
a) A function satisfying the condition of the problem increases monotonically. In fact, if $x_2 \geq x_1$ and $x_2 \geq 1$, then $f (x_2) \geq f (x_1) + f (x_2-x_1)$ and $f (x_2-x_1) \geq  0$; consequently, $f (x_2) \geq f (x_1)$. Therefore, if $½ $<$x \geq 1$, since $f (1) = 1$, we have
$f (x) \leq 1 \leq 2x$.
<p>


Now let $0 $<$x \leq ½$. We take a natural number n such that $½ $<$nx \leq 1$ $($it is clear that this can always be done$)$. It is easy to prove $($by induction$)$ that if $x \geq 0$ and $nx \leq 1$, then $f (nx) \geq nf (x)$. For $½ $<$nx \leq 1$, it is already proved that $f (nx) \leq 2 \times nx$.
<p>
Therefore, $nf (x) \leq f (nx) \leq 2 \times nx$, whence $f (x) \leq 2x$ and for $0 $<$x \leq ½$.
Now, it only remains to find out what will happen at zero. We take $0 $<$x_1 \leq 1$; then
$f (x_1) = f (0 + x_1) \geq f (0) + f (x_1)$.
<p>

But by definition $f (0) \geq 0$, therefore, $f (0) = 0$.
<p>
b)	The answer: no, it is not true.
<p>
Let us give an example. We define the function as follows:
f $($x$)$ = <IMG SRC="73808 a.gif">
<p>

If $1 \geq x_1 \geq x_2 \geq 0$ and $x_1 + x_2 \leq 1$, then $x_2 \leq ½$ and $f (x_2) = 0$.
Consequently, $f (x_1 + x_2) \geq f (x_1) + f (x_2)$ and the function in question satisfies the requirements of the problem.
At the same time,
$f (\frac{51}{100}) = 1> 1.9 \times \frac{51}{100}$.

b) No, it is not true.
