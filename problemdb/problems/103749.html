<h1>Problem ID 103749</h1>
<p>
Know-it-all came to visit the twin brothers Screw and Nut, knowing that one of them never speaks the truth, and asked one of them: "Are you Screw?". "Yes," he replied. When Know-it-all asked the second brother the same question, he received an equally clear answer and immediately determined who was who.
Who was called Screw?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
If they gave the same answer, then Know-it-all could not distinguish between them.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
If they gave the same answer, then Know-it-all could not distinguish between them. So, the second one answered: "No". Now, if Screw was first, it would turn out that both told the truth. But this contradicts the condition. So, Screw is the second brother, and they both lied $($which is not forbidden by the condition$)$.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
	The second.
