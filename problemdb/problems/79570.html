<h1>Problem ID 79570</h1>
<p>
In a group of seven boys, everyone has at least three brothers who are in that group. Prove that all seven are brothers.


</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Take any two boys from this group. Suppose they are not brothers. Then each of them has three brothers among the remaining five boys. Therefore, they have a common brother, which means they are brothers. So, following this logic, any two boys from this group are brothers.
