<h1>Problem ID 30829</h1>
<p>
Some two teams scored the same number of points in a volleyball tournament.
Prove that there are teams A, B and C, in which A beat B, B beat C and C beat A.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let A and B score the same number of points, and A beat B. If for each team C which was beaten by B, A beat, then A must have a greater number of points than B. So there is a team C which B beat and which managed to beat A.
