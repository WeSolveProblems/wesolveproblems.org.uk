<h1>Problem ID 79498</h1>
<p>
  The product of a group of 48 natural numbers has exactly 10 prime factors. Prove that the product of some four of the numbers in the group will always give a square number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Let us represent the product of an arbitrary pair $(a, b)$ from the numbers given as the square of a natural number multiplied by prime factors to the first power, for example, if $a=2^{13} \times 3^4 \times 19^3, \ b=5^6 \times 7^7 \times 19$ then $ab=K^2 \times 2 \times 7$ where $K= 2^6 \times 3^2 \times 5^3 \times 7^3 \times 19^2$.
</p>
<p>
  Compare the number of possible pairs $(a, b)$ and the number of possible combinations of prime factors. The total number of possible pairs from 48 numbers is equal to $^{48}C_2=1128$, and the total number of combinations possible from 10 prime factors (including an empty combination) is $2^{10}=1024$. Since $1128>1024$ there will be two different pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ from the group that have the same combination of prime factors $(p_1, p_2, ..., p_k)$ present $(0 \le k \le 10)$. Hence $abcd$ must be a perfect square.
</p>
<p>
  If in this situation $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ do not share an element, then the numbers $a, b, c, d$ are the ones required. If there is a shared element (for example $b=d$) then $ac$ must be a perfect square.
</p>

<p>
  If we ignore $a$ and $c$ for a moment, we are left with a group of 46 numbers, the product of which has no more than 10 prime factors. Using the same reasoning as above, we get that $^{46}C_2=1035 > 2^{10}$, and that there must exist two different pairs $(x, y)$ and $(z, t)$ from the group, so that $xyzt$ is a perfect square. If $(x, y)$ and $(z, t)$ do not share an element, then $x, y, z, t$ are the numbers required. If they do, for example $x=t$, then $yz$ must be a perfect square. In this case the required group of 4 numbers would be $(a, c, y, z)$.
