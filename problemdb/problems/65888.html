<h1>Problem ID 65888</h1>
<p>
Hannah Montana wants to leave the round room which has six doors, five of which are locked. In one attempt she can check any three doors, and if one of them is not locked, then she will go through it. After each attempt her friend Michelle locks the door, which was opened, and unlocks one of the neighbouring doors. Hannah does not know which one exactly. How should she act in order to leave the room?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let's paint the doors in black and white colors, alternating them. For the first attempt Hannah Montana checks all the white doors. If after that she did not manage to leave the room, then a black door was the one that was unlocked. Michelle will lock that one and unlock a neighboring white one. In this case, Hannah Montana just needs to once again check all the white doors.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
Compare with the task number 65893.
