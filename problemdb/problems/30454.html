<h1>Problem ID 30454</h1>
<p>
A rook is on the $a1$ square of a chessboard. Consider the game with two players where: in one move a player can move the rook by any number of squares to the left, right or up. The winner is the player who places the rook on the square $h8$. Who would win, if the right strategy is used?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In this game the second player is the winner. The strategy used is very simple: with each move they return the rook to the $a1$-$h8$ diagonal. Let us explain why this strategy allows the second player to win. With every turn, the first player will have to move the rook away from the $a1$-$h8$ diagonal and the second player has the opportunity to move it back to this diagonal. Since the square $h8$ belongs to this diagonal, so the rook can be placed there only by the second player.
