<h1>Problem ID 57394</h1>
<p>
On a line segment of length 1, n points are given. Prove that the sum of the distances from some point out of the ones on the segment to these points is no less than n / 2.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let A and B be the endpoints of a segment; $X_1, ..., X_n$ are given points on the segment. Since $AX_i$ + $BX_i$ = 1, then $\sum$ $AX_i$ + $\sum$ $BX_i$ = n. Hence, $\sum$ $AX_i$ $\geq$ n/2 or $\sum$ $BX_i$ $\geq$ n/2.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Such a point can be, for example, one of the ends of the segment.
