<h1>Problem ID 97979</h1>
<p>
  Prove that in any group of 7 natural numbers - not necessarily consecutive - it is possible to choose three numbers such that their sum is divisible by 3.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  By the pigeon hole principle it is possible to choose three numbers out of the 7 that have the same denominator when divided by 3. Therefore their sum is also divisible by 3.
</p>

<h1>Notes </h1>
<p>
  1. It is not difficult to see that this is possible even for five natural numbers.
</p>
<p>
  2. 3 marks
