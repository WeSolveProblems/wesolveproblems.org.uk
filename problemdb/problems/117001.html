<h1>Problem ID 117001</h1>
<p>
Author: S.V. Usov 
<p>
In the family of happy gnomes there is a father, a mother and a child. The names of the family members: Alex, Charlie and Jo. At the dinner table two gnomes made two statements. Charlie said: "Alex and Jo are of different genders. Alex and Charlie are my parents”. Alex said: "I am Jo’s father. I am the daughter of Charlie”. Who is who? That is, what is the name of the father, the mother and the child, if it is known that each gnome lied once, and each told the truth once. 

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
If Charlie and Alex are Jo’s parents, then they are of different genders, and both of Jo’s statements are true, which is impossible. Therefore, Charlie and Alex are of different genders, but one of them is not a parent. So, Jo is a parent. In this case, Alex cannot be the father of Jo, and from Alex’s statements the second is true: she is the daughter of Charlie. Since Alex and Charlie are of different genders, Charlie is Alex’s father, then Jo is her mother.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Alex is the child. Charlie is the father. Jo is the mother.
