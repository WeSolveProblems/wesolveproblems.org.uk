<h1>Problem ID 89905</h1>
Everyone believed that the Dragon was one-eyed, two-eared, three-legged, four-nosed and five-headed. In fact, only four of these definitions form a certain pattern, and one is redundant. Which characteristic is unnecessary?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
Redundant definition - four-nosed. In all of other definitions, the body part characteristic contains the letter “E” twice, whereas the word “nosed” has only one “E”.
