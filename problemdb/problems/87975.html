<h1>Problem ID 87975</h1>
<p>
A three-digit number ABB is given, the product of the digits of which is a two-digit number AC and the product of the digits of this number is C $($here, as in mathematical puzzles, the digits in the numbers are replaced by letters where the same letters correspond to the same digits and different letters to different digits$)$. Determine the original number.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
Think about what is equal to A.

</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
From the condition of the problem, we see that AC = C; then A = 1 and BB = 10 + C, where C is a digit. The last equation has a unique solution where B = 4, C = 6. Hence, the original number is 144.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
144
