<h1>Problem ID 65400</h1>
<p>
What is the smallest number of cells that can be chosen on a $15\times15$ board so that a mouse positioned on any cell on the board touches at least two marked cells? $($The mouse also touches the cell on which it stands.$)$
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
It is more convenient to solve the problem in a general way: we show that on the board $($2n + 1$) \times ($2n + 1$)$ $($where n$>$ 1$)$ the answer is 4n. $($The figure corresponds to the case n = 3$)$.

The first method:
<p>
Mark the cells on the perimeter of the rectangle $($2n-1$)\times 3$, as shown in the figure. In this case, two cells are marked on long diagonals $($from more than n + 1 cells$)$. Only four cells of the board $($they are painted in the picture$)$ do not lie on long diagonals, but for them the required condition is fulfilled.
</p>
We will show that a smaller number of marked cells cannot be dispensed with. We will arrange 8n mice in all cells along the perimeter of the board. Let k cells be marked. We estimate in two ways the number p of pairs $($of the mouse and the marked cell that he has touched$)$. Since each square of the board is touched by no more than four mice, then p $\leq$ 4k. But each mouse must touch at least two marked cells, so p $\geq$ 8n \times 2$. Hence, 16n $\leq$ 4k, that is, k $\geq$ 4n.

28 cells.
