<h1>Problem ID 88198</h1>
<p>
What are the eight coins you need to take, so that you can use them to pay without change any amount from 1 pence up to 1 pound?
$($In circulation at the time, there were coins of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 50 pence$)$.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Try to break this problem into two: first find coins with which you can pay any amount from 1 to 10 pence, then â€“ coins with which you can pay 10, 20, ..., 90 pence.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Take coins worth 1, 1, 3, 5, 10, 10, 20, 50 pence. It is easy to verify that the first four coins allow you to pay any amount from 1 to 9 pence, and the last four - any multiple of 10 from 10 to 100 pence. Therefore, having this set of coins, you can pay any amount from 1 pence up to 100 pence.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
1, 1, 3, 5, 10, 10, 20, 50 pence.
