<h1>Problem ID 35566</h1>
<p>An area of airspace contains clouds. It turns out that the area can be divided by 10 aeroplanes into regions such that each region contains no more than one cloud. What is the largest number of clouds an aircraft can fly through whilst holding a straight line course.</p>
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>How many times does the aircraft cross the boundary between regions?</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Whilst holding a straight course the aircraft can cross each plane no more than once. This means the aircraft can change regions no more than 10 times. Therefore it will have flown through no more than 11 regions, or no more than 11 clouds. This number is achieved if the aircraft's course is not parallel to any of the planes, and it does not cross any of the planes' flight paths where they intersect with one another.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>11.</p>
