<h1>Problem</h1>
An area of airspace contains clouds. It turns out that the area can be divided by 10 planes (the mathematical type, not the flying type) into regions such that each region contains no more than one cloud. What is the largest number of clouds an aircraft can fly through whilst holding a straight line course.
<h1>Hint</h1>
How many times does the aircraft cross the boundary between regions?

<h1>Solution</h1>
Whilst holding a straight course, the aircraft can cross each plane no more than once. This means the aircraft can change regions no more than 10 times. Therefore it will have flown through no more than 11 regions, hence no more than 11 clouds. This number is acheived if the aircraft's course is not parallel to any of the planes, and it does not cross any of the planes where they intersect with one another.

<h1>Answer</h1>
11
