<h1>Problem ID 56707</h1>
<p>
Two circles have radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, and the distance between their centers is d. Prove that these circles are orthogonal if and only if $d^2$ = $R_1^2$ + $R_2^2$.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the circles with centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ pass through the point A. The radii $O_1A$ and $O_2A$ are perpendicular to the tangents to circles at point A, therefore the circles are orthogonal if and only if $ \angle O_1AO_2$ = 90$^{\circ}$, that is, $O_1O_2^2$ = $O_1A_2 + O_2A_2$ .
