<h1>Problem ID 65978</h1>
<p>
On the school board a chairman is chosen. There are four candidates: A, B, C and D. A special procedure is proposed - each member of the council writes down on a special sheet of candidates the order of his preferences. For example, the sequence ACDB means that the councilor puts A in the first place, does not object very much to C, and believes that he is better than D, but least of all would like to see B. Being placed in first place gives the candidate 3 points, the second - 2 points, the third - 1 point, and the fourth - 0 points. After collecting all the sheets, the election commission summarizes the points for each candidate. The winner is the one who has the most points.
After the vote, C $($who scored fewer points than everyone $)$ withdrew his candidacy in connection with his transition to another school. They did not vote again, but simply crossed out B from all the leaflets. In each sheet there are three candidates left. Therefore, first place was worth 2 points, the second - 1 point, and the third - 0 points. The points were summed up anew.
Could it be that the candidate who previously had the most points, after the self-withdrawal of B received the fewest points?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Suppose that the council consisted of seven members, and the votes were distributed, as shown in first the table.

The points were distributed as follows: A - 13, B - 11, C - 6, D - 12. The candidate with the most points was candidate A, the one with the least - Candidate B.
When B withdrew his candidacy, the preferences table changed $($ second table $)$. The scores also changed: A - 6, C - 7, D - 8.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes it could.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. Strangely, the candidate with the lowest rating changed the results of the elections, by simply ceasing to participate in them, and the leader then became an outsider. This and other paradoxes of elections and the famous Arrow theorem are described in detail in the book by R.E. Klima, J.K. Hodge. "Mathematics of elections". Moscow. MCNMO. 2007.

2. 2 points.
