<h1>Problem ID 98298</h1>
<p>
The real numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, ..., $a_{1996}$ are written in a series. Prove that it is possible to single out one or more neighbouring numbers so that their sum will differ from an integer by less than 0.001.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We form the numbers $b_1$ = {$a_1$}, $b_2$ = {$a_1$ + $a_2$}, $b_3$ = {$a_1$ + $a_2$ + $a_3$}, ..., $b_{1996}$ = {$a_1$ + $a_2$ + $a_3$ + ... + $a_{1996}$}. Divide the segment [0, 1] into 1001 lengths of 1/1001. Some two of the numbers $b_1$, ..., $b_{1996}$ will be on the same line $($let it be $b_i$ and $b_j$, i $<$ j$)$. This means that $a_{i + 1}$ + ... + $a_j$ differs from an integer by no more than 1/1001 $<$ 0,001.
