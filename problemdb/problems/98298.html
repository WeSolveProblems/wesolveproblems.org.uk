<h1>Problem ID 98298</h1>
<p>
Some real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3,...,a_1_9_9_6$ are written in a row. Prove that it is possible to pick one or several adjacent numbers, so that their sum is less than 0.001 away from a whole number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Create the numbers $b_1={a_1}, b_2={a_1+a_2}, b_3={a_1+a_2+a_3},...,b_1_9_9_8={a_1, a_2, a_3,...,a_1_9_9_6}$.
</p>
<p>
Consider only the decimal part of each $b$ number. Divide the range $[0,1]$ into 1001 line segments of length $\frac{1}{1001}$. Some two of the numbers $b_1,...,b_1_9_9_6$ will end up in the same line segment, let these be $b_i$ and $b_j , i < j$. 
</p>
<p>
This means that $a_i+1+...+a_j$ differs from a whole number by no more than $\frac{1}{1001} < 0.001$.
