<h1>Problem ID 30780</h1>
<p>
Prove that there is no graph with five vertices whose degrees are equal to 4, 4, 4, 4, 2.
</p>


</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the degree of each of the four vertices be equal to 4. This means that each of them is connected to all of the other vertices $($including the fifth one$)$. Hence, the degree of the fifth vertex is also equal to 4.
