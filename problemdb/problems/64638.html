<h1>Problem ID 64638</h1>
<p>
The numbers x, y and z are such that all three numbers x + yz, y + zx and z + xy are rational, and $x^2$ + $y^2$ = 1. Prove that the number $xyz^2$ is also rational.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
$xyz^2$ = $xyz^2$ + z - z = $xyz^2$ + $($x^2 + y^2$)$ z - z = $($yz + x$)$ $($zx + y$)$ - $($xy + z$)$.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
It does not follow from the conditions of the problem that all three numbers x, y, z are rational. For example, these conditions are satisfied by a triple of numbers
