<h1>Problem ID 35575</h1>
<p>
A convex figure and point A inside it are given. Prove that there is a chord $($that is, a segment joining two boundary points of a convex figure$)$ passing through point A and dividing it in half at point A.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Continuously rotate the chord. Prove that with this rotation we will achieve the desired position.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Draw some chord through A. We denote by a and b the lengths of the segments to which the chord is divided by point A. Let's begin to rotate the chord anticlockwise $($thereby continuously changing the direction of the chord$)$. In this case, the quantity a depends continuously on the rotation angle $ \phi $, that is $ a = a (\phi) $. In the same way, b continuously depends on the angle of rotation $ \phi $. Consider the difference a-b as a function of $ \phi $. At the initial instant, this quantity is equal to $ a (0) -b (0) $, with a rotation of 1800, the segments to which point A breaks the chord are interchanged, i.e. $ a (\pi) -b (\pi) = - (a (0) -b (0)) $. Thus, at the ends of the segment $ [0; \pi] $ the function $ a (\phi) -b (\phi) $ takes values of different signs, therefore for some $ \phi \in [0; \ pi] $ the equality $ a (\phi) -b (\phi) = 0 $, i.e. equality of the lengths of chord segments is achieved.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
