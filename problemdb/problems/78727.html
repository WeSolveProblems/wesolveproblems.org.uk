<h1>Problem ID 78727</h1>
<p>
  The numbers $1, 2, 3, ..., 99$ are written onto 99 blank cards in order. The cards are then shuffled and then spread in a row face down. The numbers $1, 2, 3, .., 99$ are once more written onto in the blank side of the cards in order. For each card, the numbers written on it are then added together. The 99 resulting summations are then multiplied together. Prove that the result will be an even number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Amongst the numbers $1, 2, ..., 99$ there are 50 odd numbers and 49 even numbers. Consider the 50 cards containing odd numbers. The opposite side of at least one of these cards must have an odd number written on it, meaning the sum of the numbers on that card is even, meaning the product of all the cards will also be even.
