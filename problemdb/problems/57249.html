<h1>Problem ID 57249</h1>
<p>
Inside an angle two points, A and B, are given. Construct a circle which passes through these points and cuts the sides of the angle into equal segments.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The circle cuts the sides of the angle into equal segments if and only if its center lies on the bisector of the angle. Therefore, the center of the required circle is the point of intersection of the middle perpendicular to the segment AB and the bisector of the given angle.
