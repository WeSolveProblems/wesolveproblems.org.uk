<h1>Problem ID 65282</h1>
<p>
A marketing company decided to carry out a sociological survey to find out which part of the urban population learns news mostly from radio programs, which part - from TV programs, which part - from the press, and which - from the Internet. For the study, it was decided to use a sample of 2,000 randomly chosen owners of email addresses. Can this sample be considered representative?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
The sample is unrepresentative, since two events: A = {this person has an email} and B = {this person uses the Internet} are dependent. On the other hand, people who use the Internet, for the most part use it, in particular, for reading news. Thus, the percentage of people who say that they will learn news from the Internet, in this sample will be a greater proportion that among the general population.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
It is not a representative sample.
