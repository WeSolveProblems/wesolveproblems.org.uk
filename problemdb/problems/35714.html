<h1>Problem ID 35714</h1>
<p>
There are 8 glasses of water on the table. You are allowed to take any two of the glasses and make them have equal volumes of water &#40;by pouring some water from one glass into the other&#41;. Prove that, by using such operations, you can eventually get all the glasses to contain equal volumes of water.

</p>


<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
8 is a power of 2. First solve this problem for 4 glasses and then for 8.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let us separate the glasses into pairs A-A', B-B', C-C', D-D', and then equalise the volume of water in each pair of glasses. Then we have two identical sets of four glasses: A, B, C, D and A', B', C', D'. We will then equalise the volume of water in the first set of four glasses and aftwerwards use the same method for the second set of four glasses. Thus we have made the problem into one with four glasses. Similarly, we separate the four glasses into pairs, equalise the volume of water in each pair, and thus transform the problem into one with two glasses. However, we can equalise the water volume in two glasses as stated in the problem.
