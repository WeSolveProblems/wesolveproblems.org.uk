<h1>Problem ID 65558</h1>
<p>
Harry thought of two positive numbers x and y. He wrote down the numbers x + y, x - y, xy and x/y on a board and showed them to Sam, but did not say which number corresponded to which operation.
Prove that Sam can uniquely figure out x and y.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Note that
<p>

By searching, we can find on the board a pair of numbers, where a $<$b, whose arithmetic mean is equal to the geometric mean of the remaining pair of numbers c and d. Below we shall prove that such a partition is unique $($up to a permutation of equal numbers$)$, therefore a = x - y, b = x + y, and hence

<p>
we can prove uniqueness. If in the equation,

two unequal numbers from different parts of the equation are exchanged, then the equality is violated: one of the parts will increase and the other will decrease. It is also impossible to change pairs entirely: a negative number cannot stand under the root, and if all the numbers are nonnegative, then

and the equality is achieved only when all four numbers are equal, which is impossible as: x + y$>$x - y.
