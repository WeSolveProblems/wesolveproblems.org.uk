<h1>Problem ID 21983</h1>
<p>51 points were thrown into a square of side 1m. Prove that it is possible to cover some set of 3 points with a square of side 20cm.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Divide the 1m large square into 25 small squares of side 20cm. Using the pigeon hole principle we know that at least one small square must contain at least three dots. </p>
