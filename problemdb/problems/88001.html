<h1>Problem ID 88001</h1>
<p>
A traveller rents a room in an inn for a week and offers the innkeeper a chain of seven silver links as payment - one link per day, with the condition that they will be payed everyday. The innkeeper agrees, with the condition that the traveller can only cut one of the links. How did the traveller manage to pay the innkeeper?


</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
The traveller can give a few connected links and receive change in the form of links.

</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The traveller must cut the third link. Then they will get: 1 link, a chain of 2 links and a chain of 4 links. On the first day, the traveller will give the innkeeper 1 link. On the second day, he will give the chain of 2 links and will take 1 link back. On the third day, the he will give 1 link. On the fourth, he will give the chain of 4 links and take back 1 link and the chain of 2 links. On the fifth day, the traveller will give 1 link. On the sixth day, the traveller will give the chain of 2 links and take 1 link back. On the final (seventh) day, he will give 1 link.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
Having cut the third link, the traveller will have 1 link, a chain of 2 links, and a chain of 4 links. Everyday the traveller will either give: 1 link, or a chain of 2 links and taking 1 link back as change, or 4 links and taking 1 link and a chain of 2 links back as change.
