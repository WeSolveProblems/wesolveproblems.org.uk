<h1>Problem ID 65774</h1>
<p>
At a factory known to us, we cut out metal disks with a diameter of 1 m. It is known that a disk with a diameter of exactly 1 m weighs exactly 100 kg. During manufacturing, a measurement error occurs, and therefore the standard deviation of the radius is 10 mm. Engineer Gavin believes that a stack of 100 disks on average will weigh 10,000 kg. By how much is the engineer Gavin wrong?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
By the condition, ER = 0.5 m, DR = $10^{-4}$ $m^2$. Let's find the mathematical expectation of the area of one disk: $ES = E(πR^2) = πER^2 = π(DR + E^2R) = π (10^{-4} + 0.25) = 0.2501π$.
Hence, the mathematical expectation of the mass of the disk is $0.2501π/0.25π \times 100$ = 100.04 kg. Consequently, a stack of 100 disks on average will weigh 10004 kg.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
By 4 kg.
