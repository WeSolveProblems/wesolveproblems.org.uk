<h1>Problem ID 35105</h1>
<p>
Are there any irrational numbers a and b such that the degree of $a^b$ is a rational number?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1> 
As a, we can take a root of a natural number.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
The first solution. An example is the numbers a = $10^{1/2}$, b = 2lg11. In fact, $a^b$ = $(10^{1/2})^{2lg11}$ = $10^{$($1/2$)$ * 2lg11}$ = $10^lg11$ = 11. It remains to show that the numbers $10^{1/2}$ and lg11 are irrational. If $10^{1/2}$ = m / n for some positive integers m and n, then the equality $10n^2$ = $m^2$ would be true, which is impossible, since the simple factor 2 enters the left-hand side in an odd degree, but on the right-hand side in even one. If the equality lg11 = m / n for some natural numbers m and n were satisfied, then the equality $10^m$ = $11^n$ would be true, which is obviously impossible.
<p>
The second solution. Consider the number A = $√2^{√2}$. If it is rational, the problem is solved $($the number √2, as is known, is irrational$)$. If A is irrational, then the number $A^{√2}$ = $√2^2$ = 2 is rational, therefore A and √2 are the required numbers.

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
Yes, there does exist.
