<h1>Problem ID 102841</h1>
<p>
Two weighings. There are 7 coins which are identical on the surface, including 5 real ones $($all of the same weight$)$ and 2 counterfeit coins $($both of the same weight, but lighter than the real ones$)$. How can you find the 3 real coins with the help of two weighings on scales without weights?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We number the coins 1, 2, ..., 7. For the first weighing, weigh the coins 1, 2, 3 on one side, and on the other side, the coins 4, 5, 6.
<p>
a)	In the case when the scales are in equilibrium, there is one false coin on each side, and therefore, 7 is a real coin. The second weighing is made up of 1 and 2 coins. When the scales are in equilibrium then the coins 1, 2, 7 are real. If 1 is heavier than 2, then 1, 3, 7 are real.
<p>
b) If there is no equilibrium during the first weighing, the heavier group of three coins consists of real coins.
