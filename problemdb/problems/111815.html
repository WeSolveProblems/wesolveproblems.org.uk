<h1>Problem ID 111815</h1>
<p>
Given a square trinomial f $(x)$ = $x^2$ + ax + b. It is known that for any real x there exists a real number y such that f $(y)$ = f $(x)$ + y. Find the greatest possible value of a.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
It follows from the condition that the quadratic equation f $(y)$ - y - f $(x)$ = 0 is solvable with respect to y for any x. Substituting x = - a / 2, we obtain the equation $y^2$ + $(a-1)$ y + $a^2$ / 4, whose discriminant is equal to $(a - 1)^2$ - $a^2$ = 1 - 2a, whence a $≤$ 1/2. On the other hand, if a = 1/2, then for any x we can put y = -x: then f $(y)$ = $x^2$ - 1/2 x + b = $(x^2 + 1 x + b)$ - x = f $(x)$ + y , as required.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
a = ½.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. Also suitable is y = x + ½.
<p>
2. It is easy to verify that, for x = -a / 2, the minimum of the discriminant of the trinomial f $(y)$ - y - f $(x)4 is attained. Therefore, if it is nonnegative for x = -a / 2, then it is always nonnegative.
