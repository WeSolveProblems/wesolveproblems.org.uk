<h1>Problem ID 61535</h1>
<p>
Prove that the 13th day of the month is more likely to occur on a Friday than on other days of the week. It is assumed that we live in the Gregorian style calendar.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Take advantage of the fact that the number of days in the 400-year cycle is divisible by 7.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  Recall that the year is not a leap year if its number is not divisible by 4 and if its number is divisible by 100, but not by 400. A non-leap year consists of 52 weeks and one day, and in a leap year, there is one day more. Thus, the number of days in the 400-year cycle is comparable to 300 + 100 - 3 = 497 (mod 7), that is, divisible by 7. Therefore, it is sufficient to investigate one such cycle, for example, from year 2000 to 2399.
<p>
  If the 13th day of the month is Friday, then the first day of this month is Sunday. Therefore, we must check that the month mostly starts on a Sunday.
  We divide the years into 7 types corresponding to the first day of the year: the year of the 1st type starts on a Monday, the second on a Tuesday, ..., the 6th on a Saturday, and the 0th on a Sunday. If a non-leap year is of type n, then the next year is of type n + 1 $($mod 7$)$. If the shaded year is of type n, then the next year is of type n + 2 $($mod 7$)$, and the next leap year is of type n - 2 $($mod 7$)$. For example, as can be seen from the calendar, 2000 is a sixth-type year, 2001 is a non-leap year of type 1, and 2004 is a leap year of type 4.
  It is easy to verify. that in the non-leap year of type 0, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday will be 1st one time, Friday, Saturday and Sunday - 2 times, and Wednesday - 3 times. In a leap year of type 0, Monday, Tuesday and Friday will be 1st one time, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday - 2 times, and Sunday - 3 times. In years of other types, a corresponding shift occurs; for example, in a leap year of type 1, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday will be the 1st number one time, Saturday, Sunday and Monday - 2 times, Thursday - 3 times.
<p>
  In our 400-year cycle there are two kinds of sub-cycles. First, it is 7 consecutive non-leap years $($for example, 2097 - 2103$)$. It is clear that in such a cycle a non-leap year of each type occurs once. Secondly, these are 28 consecutive years, of which exactly 7 are leap years $($for example, 2000 - 2027$)$. It is not difficult to verify that here, such a leap year of each type occurs once, and a leap year of each type occurs three times. Years included in such cycles can be excluded from consideration and this leaves only 2000 - 2012, 2104 - 2112, 2204 - 2212, 2304 - 2312, 2397 - 2399.
<p>
  Note that due to the cyclicity, the year 2104 starts on the same day of the week as the 2097th, 2013th, and therefore 2008: from 2008 to 2013 there is a shift by
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 days. It means that the period 2104 - 2112 can be replaced by the period 2008 - 2016. Similarly, the periods 2204 - 2212, 2304 - 2312, 2397 - 2399 are replaced by the periods of 2012 - 2020, 2016 - 2024 and 2025 - 2027 respectively. Applying the resulted periods, we get a 28-year cycle of 2000 - 2027 plus a gap of 2008 - 2020 and another for 2012 and 2016.
<p>
  So, we have in consideration the non-leap years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2019, that are, respectively, of types 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2 and leap years 2008, 2012, 2012 , 2016, 2016, 2020, that are, respectively, of types 2, 0, 0, 5, 5, 3. Removing from non-leap years the types from 0 to 6, we leave only types 2 and 4, which gives 5 numbers for Sundays as the 1st numbers, 4 Tuesdays, 4 Fridays, 3 Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays and one Saturday. The leap years add 11 Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays, 10 Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and 9 Mondays. In total, we have, 16 Sundays, 15 Tuesdays and Fridays, 13 Wednesdays and Thursdays and 12 Mondays.
<p>
  We see that Sunday is the 1st number a little more often than every other day of the week.
