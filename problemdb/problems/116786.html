<h1>Problem ID 116786</h1>
<p>
Matt, Conrad and Louie ate some sweets. Their surnames are Smith, Jones and Cooper. Smith ate 2 sweets fewer than Matt, Jones - 2 sweets fewer than Conrad, and Conrad ate more than anyone. Which of them has which last name?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Smith ate less than Matt, and Conrad ate more than all, therefore Conrad is not Smith. For the same reason, Conrad is not Jones, that is, the surname of Conrad is Cooper. Smith is not Matt, so Smith is called Louie. Hence, Jones's name is Matt.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Conrad Cooper, Matt Jones, Louie Smith.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
The condition is consistent. Indeed, Louie Smith ate two sweets fewer than Matt Jones, who, in turn, ate two sweets fewer than Conrad Cooper.
