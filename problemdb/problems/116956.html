<h1>Problem ID 116956</h1>
<p>
Here's a rather simple rebus:
<p>
EX is four times larger than OJ.
<p>
AJ is four times larger than OX.
<p>
Find the sum of all four numbers.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The numbers J and X are even, because the numbers EX and AJ are divisible by 4. The numbers OJ and OX are smaller than 25, otherwise, when multiplied by 4, they will cease to be two-digit numbers. Hence, 0 is a two or a one. Let us consider the first case. The number 20 as OX or OJ is not suitable, since 80 ends with the same digit. The number 22 also does not fit. This leaves only the number 24, but the numbers OD and OX must be different. If an even number is added to an even number, which is 4 times as large, then a multiple of 10 is obtained. Consequently, J + X = 10. Then
OJ + OX = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, and the sum of all four numbers is five times larger, that is, 150.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
150.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
1. A small search can be used to find all the numbers: OX and OJ are 12 and 18 $($ in any order $)$, and AJ and EX are 48 and 72 respectively.

2. 4 points.
