<h1>Problem ID 102981</h1>
<p>
If yesterday was Thursday, what day will be yesterday for the day after tomorrow?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Notice, "for yesterday, tomorrow" is "today".
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
"Yesterday for tomorrow" is "today", and "yesterday for the day after tomorrow" is "tomorrow". So, if "yesterday is tomorrow", which is Thursday, then "yesterday for the day after tomorrow" is Friday.
