<h1>Problem ID 30795</h1>
<p>
There are seven lakes in some country, connected by ten non-overlapping canals, and each lake can be reached from any other. How many islands are there in this country?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Consider a flat graph whose vertices correspond to lakes, and edges to channels. Letâ€™s cut the plane into F pieces. According to Euler's formula $($ task number 30759 $)$ 7-10 + F = 2, that is F = 5. One of these pieces is the continent, and the rest are islands.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
4 islands.
