<h1>Problem ID 104879</h1>
<p>
There are 12 people in a room. Some of them are honest &#40;i.e. always tell the truth&#41; and the rest always lie. "There are no honest people here," said the first person. "There is not more than one honest person here," said the second person. The third person said that there are no more than 2 honest people, the fourth person said there are no more than 3 honest people, and so on until the twelfth person, who said there are no more than 11 honest people. How many honest people are in the room?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Notice that if someone in the room had lied, then all the people speaking before them had also lied. There must be honest people in the room, since if the first person had said the truth that "there are no honest people here", then the first person must be a liar and this is a contradiction.
<br>
Let the number of liars in the room be $x$. The last liar said that there are no more than $&#40;x-1&#41;$ honest people in the room. This means that actually there are no less than $x$ honest people. Then the $&#40;x+1&#41;$-th person already said the truth that there are no more than $x$ honest people. This means that there are $x$ honest people. It follows that there are 6 honest people in the room.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
There are 6 honest people.
