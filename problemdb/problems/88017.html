<h1>Problem ID 88017</h1>
<p>
Decipher the following rebus. Despite the fact that only two figures are known here, and all the others are replaced by asterisks, the question can be restored.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
What are the second and fourth digits of the quotient equal to? What are the first and last digits of the quotient equal to?
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
From the location of the stars in the rebus, you can immediately conclude that the second and fourth digits of the quotient are zeros.

The divisor multiplied by 8 gives a two-digit number, and when multiplied by the first and fifth digits of the quotient, it gives a three-digit number, then the first and last digits of the quotient are 9, and the whole quotient is 90809. We find the divisor. This is a two-digit number that, when multiplied by 8, gives a two-digit number, and when multiplied by 9, it gives a three-digit number.

From this it is easy to conclude that the divisor is 12. Knowing the divisor and the quotient, we restore the dividend, and then the entire question $($see on the right$)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
1 089 708/ 12 = 90 809.
