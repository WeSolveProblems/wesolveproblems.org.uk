<h1>Problem ID 65288</h1>
<p>
In competitions on stuffing bellies, the chances of opponents winning are the same as the masses of their bodies. Harry weighs more than Will, and Connor weighs less than Sam. It is not possible to draw in such a duel. Harry and Will take turns to compete with Connor and Sam. Which of these events is more likely:
A = {Harry will win against only Connor, and Will only against Sam} or B = {Harry will win only against Sam and Will only wins against Connor}?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
We denote the masses of the opponents Harry, Will, Connor and Sam as u, j, p, b, respectively . The probability that Harry will win only against Connor is equal to the product of the probabilities that he will defeat Connor and lose to Sam, that is

Likewise, the probability that Will will win only against Sam is

Consequently, the probability P (A) of the event A is

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
The probabilities are equal.
</p>
 
<h1>Remarks</h1>
<p>
The terms "Harry weighs more than Will" and "Connor weighs less than Sam" are superfluous.
