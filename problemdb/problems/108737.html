<h1>Problem ID 108737</h1>
<p>
Solve problem number 108736 for the inscription A, BC, DEF, CGH, CBE, EKG.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Similar to the previous problem, let's look at the first two numbers. The first number is single-digit, and the second is two-digit. Therefore, their difference is less than 100. Therefore, the digit in the hundred digit each time increases by no more than 1, from where D = 1, C = 2, E = 3. Therefore we get the record: A, B2, 13F, 2GH, 2B3, 3KG. Similar to the previous problem, 3d = 2B3 - B2 = 201, d = 67. From here it is easy to restore the inscription: 5, 72, 139, 206, 273, 340.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
5, 72, 139, 206, 273, 340.
