<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  Prove that if 21 people collected 200 nuts between them, there are two people in the group who collected the same number of nuts.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

  If each person collected a different number of nuts, there would be at least $1+2+3+...+20=210 $ nuts, which contradicts the conditions given in the problem.
