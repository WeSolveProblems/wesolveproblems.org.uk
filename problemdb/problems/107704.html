<h1>Problem ID 107704</h1>
<p>
In a class there are 50 children. Some of the children know all the letters except "h" and they miss this letter out when writing. The rest know all the letters except "c" which they also miss out. One day the teacher asked 10 of the pupils to write the word "cat", 18 other pupils to write "hat" and the rest to write the word "chat". The words "cat" and "hat" each ended up being written 15 times. How many of the pupils wrote their word correctly?

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Nobody wrote the word "chat" because no one in the class can write both the letter "c" and the letter "h". So "cat" or "hat" must have been written by $10+18=28$ people. We notice that the only words written were "cat", "hat" or "at". The first two words were each written 15 times and so "at" was written by $50-15-15=20$ out of 28 pupils. This means that only 8 people wrote their word correctly.
</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
8 pupils.
