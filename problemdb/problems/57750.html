<h1>Problem ID 57750</h1>
<p>
Prove that the medians of the triangle ABC intersect at one point and that point divides the medians in a ratio of 2: 1, counting from the vertex.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
We place unit masses at the points A, B and C. Let O be the center of mass of this system of points. The point O is also the center of mass of the point A with mass 1 and the point $A_1$ with mass 2, where $A_1$ is the center of mass of the points B and C with unit masses, ie, $A_1$ is the midpoint of the segment BC. Therefore, the point O lies on the median $AA_1$ and divides it in the ratio AO: $OA_1$ = 2: 1. Similarly, it can be proved that the remaining medians pass through the point O and are divided in a ratio of 2: 1.
