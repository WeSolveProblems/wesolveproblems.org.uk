<h1>Problem ID 35797</h1>
<p>
 In one urn there are two white balls, in another two black ones, in the third - one white and one black. On each urn there was a sign indicating its contents: WW, BB, WB. Someone rehung the signs so that now each sign indicating the contents of the urn is incorrect. You are allowed to remove balls from any urn without looking into it.
 What is the minimum number of removals required to determine the composition of all three urns?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Substantially use the condition that not one of the labels indicates the contents correctly.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We take out the ball from the urn with the WB sign. If we removed a white ball, then in this urn there are two white balls $($otherwise the table would indicate the contents correctly$)$. Next, we determine that in an urn with a BB sign there can be only one white and one black ball $($otherwise the table would indicate the contents correctly$)$. There was only one possibility left - in the urn with a sign of WW there are two black balls. If we removed a black ball from the urn with a black ball, we similarly define that there are two black balls in it, in the urn with a sign of WW there is one white and one black ball, and in an urn with a sign of BB there are two white balls.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
One extraction is enough!
