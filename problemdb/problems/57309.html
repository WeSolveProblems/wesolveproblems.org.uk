<h1>Problem ID 57309</h1>
<p>
a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of an arbitrary triangle. Prove that a = y + z, b = x + z and c = x + y, where x, y and z are positive numbers.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Solving the system of equations x + y = c, x + z = b, y + z = a, we obtain x = $($-a + b + c$)$ / 2, y = $($a-b + c$)$ / 2, z = $($ a + b - c$)$ / 2. The positivity of the numbers x, y and z follows from the triangle inequality.
