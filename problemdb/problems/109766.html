<h1>Problem ID 109766</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to arrange natural numbers from 1 to $2002^2$ in the cells of a $2002\times2002$ table so that for each cell of this table one could choose a triplet of numbers, from a row or column, where one of the numbers is equal to the product of the other two?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Numbers from 1 to 2001 can be located in a row or column no greater than the 2001st one. Hence, there is a row and column, in which all the numbers are no less than 2002. But then the product of any two numbers from such a row $($column$)$ is greater than $2002^2$, that is, for the cell located at the intersection of such a row and column, the condition is not satisfied.
 

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
You cannot.
