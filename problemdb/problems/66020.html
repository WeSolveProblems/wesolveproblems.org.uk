<h1>Problem ID 66020</h1>
<p>
Harry chose 2017 $($ not necessarily different $)$ natural numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_{2017}$ and plays by himself in the following game. Initially, he has an unlimited supply of stones and 2017 large empty boxes. In one move Harry adds $a_1$ stones to any box $($ of his choice $)$, in any of the remaining boxes $($ of his choice $)$ - $a_2$ stones, ..., finally, in the remaining box - $a_{2017}$ stones. Harry’s purpose is to ensure that after some amount of moves in all boxes there is an equal number of stones. Could he choose such numbers so that the goal could be achieved in 43 moves, but not - for a smaller non-zero number of moves.
 
</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
2017 = $43 \times 46$ + 39. Suppose that among Harry’s numbers there are 39 twos, 46 numbers equal to 44, and the rest are ones.
To achieve the required goal in 43 moves, Harry chooses 39 boxes, in which he always places 2 stones. After 43 turns will have 43 * 2 = 86 stones. The remaining boxes he breaks into 43 groups of 46 boxes; on the i-th move, he places 44 stones in all the boxes of the i-th group and one stone in the boxes of the remaining groups. Then after 43 moves in each box of each group there will be 44 + $42 \times 1$ = 86 stones, that is, in all the boxes there will be an equal number of stones.
Let Harry make k $<$ 43 moves. Then in some box A there were 44 stones added to in a move, and in it there will be no less than $44 + (k-1) \times 1 = 43 + k$ stones. On the other hand, since 46k $<$ 2017, in some box B none of the moves will be of 44 stones, that is, there will not be more than 2k stones in it. Since k $<$ 43, then
2k $<$ k + 43, which means that in the box B there are fewer stones than in A. Thus, Harry has not yet achieved the required goal.
 
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes, he could.
 
</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
The example given is not the only one. For example, a set of numbers consisting of 42 ones, 2017 - 43 = 1974 numbers equal to a $>$ 1, and one number equal to 43a - 42 is also suitable. There are even examples with pairwise different numbers; However, the verification that they are suitable is somewhat more difficult than for the examples cited above.
