<h1>Problem ID 103955</h1>
<p>
A three-digit number, in which the first and last digit is the same is given.
<p>
Prove that the number is divisible by 7 if and only if the sum of the second and third digits is divisible by 7.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Denote the first digit of our number by the letter a, and the second letter b. By the question, the last digit is also equal to a. Then our number is
100a + 10b + a = $($98a + 7b$)$ + 3 $($a + b$)$. The first term is divisible by 7. If the second term is divisible by 7, then the number itself is divisible by 7. Conversely, if the number is divisible by 7, then the second term 3 $($a + b$)$ is divisible by 7, therefore, a + b is divisible by 7.
