<h1>Problem ID 103955</h1>
<p>
Ben and Joe play chess. In addition to a chessboard, they have one rook, which they put in the lower right corner, and they move it in turns. It can only be moved upwards or to the left (for any number of cells). The player who can not make a move, loses. Joe goes first. Who will win with the correct method?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The one who goes second, that is, Ben, will win. To do this, he needs to move the rook, after each of Joeâ€™s turns, so that the rook returns to the main diagonal, leading from the lower right corner to the upper left. In this case, after each turn of Ben, the rook will stand on this diagonal, and higher than after the previous move of Ben. This means that sooner or later after the turn of Ben the rook will be in the upper left corner, which means that Joe will have nowhere to go.

Ben will win.
