<h1>Problem ID 116256</h1>
<p>
Mark has 1000 identical cubes, each of which has one pair of opposite faces which are coloured white, another pair which are blue and a third pair that are red. He made a large $10 \times 10 \times 10$ cube from them, joining cubes to one another which have the same coloured faces. Prove that the large cube has a face which is solidly one colour.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Let the left side of the cube be a multi-colored one. Then there are two neighboring multi-colored squares. Turn the cube so that the corresponding cubes are one above the other. They form a 2 × 1 × 1-parallelepiped P with a multi-colored $($ say, blue-white $)$ left side. Then the whole horizontal face of the cube is red, and all the vertical 2 × 1-faces of the parallelepiped are blue-white. Consider a 2 × 1 × 1-parallelepiped P' adjacent to P along a 2 × 1-face. It has a blue-white face, which means that all of its 2 × 1-faces are blue-white. So continuing with this methodology, we see that in a double horizontal layer of 2 × 10 × 10 containing P, all the vertical 2 × 1 × 1 parallelepipeds have a blue-white face, and hence the common face is red. So, in a double layer, single layers of 1 × 10 × 10 are touching along the red face of 10 × 10, which means that the upper edge of the cube is also red.
