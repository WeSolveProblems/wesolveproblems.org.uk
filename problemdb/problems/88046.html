<h1>Problem ID 88046</h1>
<p>
Six sacks of gold coins were found on a sunken ship of the fourteenth century. In the first four bags, there were 60, 30, 20 and 15 gold coins. When the coins were counted in the remaining two bags, someone noticed that the number of coins in the bags has a certain sequence. Having taken this into consideration, could you say how many coins are in the fifth and sixth bags?

</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Note: all of the numbers 60, 30, 20, 15 are divisors of the number 60.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The number of coins in these bags are divisors of the number 60, written in descending order. So, in the fifth and sixth bags, there are 12 and 10 gold coins, respectively.
</p>




<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
12 and 10 coins.
