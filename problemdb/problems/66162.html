<h1>Problem ID 66162</h1>
<p>
The number x is such that both the sums S = sin 64x + sin 65x and C = cos 64x + cos 65x are rational numbers.
Prove that in both of these sums, both terms are rational.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
Note that the number $S^2$ + $C^2$ = $($sin^2 64x + cos^2 64x$)$ + $($sin^2 65x + cos^2 65x$)$ + 2 $($sin 64x sin 65x + cos 64x cos 65x$)$ = 2 + 2cos $($65x - 64x$)$ = 2 + 2cos x is rational, whence cos x is also a rational number. In light of the formula cos 2a = 2cos2a - 1, all numbers of the form cos $2^k$ a are also rational - in particular, cos 64x. Since C is rational, the second term in this sum is also rational.
