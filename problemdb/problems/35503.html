<h1>Problem ID 35503</h1>
<p>
On the Island of Bad Luck there are only knights who always tell the truth, and liars who always lie. In the government of the island there are 101 ministers. In order to reduce the budget, it was decided to reduce the number of ministers by 1. But each of the ministers said that if he was to be removed from the government, then the majority of the remaining ministers would be liars. How many knights and how many liars are there in the government?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Write down two inequalities that correspond to the statements of the minister-liar and the minister-knight.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let K be the number of knights in the government, and L the number of liars $($K + L = 101$)$. Then according to the statement of the minister-knight K - 1 $<$ 50. Hence, K $<$ 51 $($hence, in particular, it follows that the government cannot consist only of knights$)$. According to the statement of the minister-liar, $L-1 \leq 50$. Therefore, $L \leq 51$ $($hence, in particular, it follows that the government cannot consist of only liars$)$.

</p>
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
51 liars and 50 knights.
