<h1>Problem ID 110103</h1>
<p>
Is it possible to arrange the numbers 1, 2, ..., 60 in a circle in such an order that the sum of every two numbers, between which lies one number, is divisible by 2, the sum of every two numbers between which lie two numbers, is divisible by 3, the sum of every two numbers between which lie six numbers, is divisible by 7?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Let us arrange the numbers in the required way. Let us take the number 7. By assumption, the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, 42nd, 49th, 56th numbers from it clockwise are multiples of 7. We have already counted 9 different numbers, which are multiples of 7. But among the numbers from 1 to 60 there are only eight of them $($7\times1$, ..., $7\times8$)$. Therefore, we have a contradiction. 

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
You cannot.
