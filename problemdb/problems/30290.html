<h1>Problem ID 30290</h1>
<p>
a$)$ An axisymmetric convex 101-gon is given. Prove that its axis of symmetry passes through one of its vertices.
<p>
b$)$ What can be said about the case of a decagon?
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
a$)$ The vertices of a polygon are symmetric with respect to its axis of symmetry. Hence, all the vertices that do not lie on the axis are divided into pairs, that is, there is an even number of them. But 101 is an odd number.
<p>
b$)$ In a decagon, the axis of symmetry might not pass through the vertices. For example, a regular decagon has an axis of symmetry passing through the middle of the opposite sides.
