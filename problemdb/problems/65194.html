<h1>Problem ID 65194</h1>
<p>
Every day, James bakes a square cake size $3\times3$. Jack immediately cuts out for himself four square pieces of size $1\times1$ with sides parallel to the sides of the cake $($not necessarily along the $3\times3$ grid lines$)$. After that, Sarah cuts out from the rest of the cake a square piece with sides, also parallel to the sides of the cake. What is the largest piece of cake that Sarah can count on, regardless of Jack’s actions?
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
In the figure on the left, the locations of Jack’s squares are indicated, from which Sarah, obviously, cannot cut a square with a side of more than 1/3. Let us prove that a ${1/3}\times{1/3}$ box can always be cut by Sarah.

<p>
The first method:
<p>
We divide the cake into 81 boxes  ${1/3}\times{1/3}$. Each of the squares Jack cuts will touch no more than 16 of these squares. Therefore, at least 81 - 4 x 16 = 17 squares remain intact. One of them can be cut Sarah.
<p>
The second method:
<p>
In the figure on the right, five pieces of a cake of size  ${1/3}\times{1/3}$ are arranged so that each of the four squares cut by Jack will touch no more than one of them. Therefore, Sarah can always take one of these pieces.

<h1>Answer</h1>
${1/3}\times{1/3}$
