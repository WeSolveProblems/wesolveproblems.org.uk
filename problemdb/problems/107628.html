<h1>Problem ID 107628</h1>
<p>
The bank of the Nile was approached by a group of six people: three Bedouins, each with his wife. At the shore is a boat with oars, which can withstand only two people at a time. A Bedouin can not allow his wife to be without him whilst in the company of another man. Can the whole group cross to the other side?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The ferry can be carried out as follows.
First one wife takes each of the other two wives in turn across the river. Then she returns and the husbands of the two wives already on the other side of the river cross. One of those husbands then crosses back over with his wife and then that man returns to the other side of the river with the other man on the same side of the bank. Finally, the wife who having already crossed was currently on the second side of the bank takes each of the other two wives in turn to cross back over the river.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
Yes it could be possible.

</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p>
Source of the solution: the book "VO.Bugayenko., Lomonosov Tournaments., Competitions in Mathematics., MCNMO-CheRo, 1998".
