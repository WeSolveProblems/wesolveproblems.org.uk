<h1>Problem ID 87981</h1>
<p>
Try to find all natural numbers which are five times greater than their last digit.
</p>
 
<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Think about what the last digit of the desired number can be.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
When multiplied by 5, the last digit does not change, therefore it has to be 0 or 5. If the last digit is 0, then the whole number would be 0, and we are looking for natural numbers. So, the last digit is 5. And the whole number is 25. Naturally, this number cannot be more than 25, because it is 5 times larger than a single digit, i.e. cannot exceed 45.
</p>
 
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
 25.
