<h1>Problem ID 64502</h1>
<p>
All of the inhabitants of the island are either knights and speak only the truth, or liars and always lie. A traveller met five islanders. To his question: "How many knights are among you?" the first replied: "None!", and the other two answered: "One." What did the others say?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  The knight could not answer "None", since that would be a lie. Therefore, the first is a liar. The other two responded in the same way, so they are either both knights or both liars. But if they were knights, then there are at least two knights on the island, and the answer "One" will be false. Therefore, the second and third are liars. <p>

  It turns out that of the five inhabitants of the island, at least three are liars, and there are no more than two knights. But since the first three lied, there are neither 0 nor 1 knights. So, the two remaining islanders are knights. And each of them will answer with the truth: "Two."

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
"Two".
