<h1>Problem ID 61458</h1>
<p>
Definition: The sequence of numbers $a_0, a_1, ..., a_n,$ ..., which, with the given p and q, satisfies the relation
$a_{n + 2} = pa_{n + 1} + qa_n$ $($n = 0,1,2, ...$)$ 
is called a linear recurrent sequence of the second order.

The equation $x^2$-px-q = 0 is called a characteristic equation of the sequence $$($a_n$$)$.

Prove that, if the numbers $a_0, a_1$ are fixed, then all of the other terms of the sequence {$a_n$} are uniquely determined.

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Prove this by induction.
