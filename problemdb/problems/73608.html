<h1>Problem ID 73608</h1>
<p>
 On a lottery ticket, it is necessary for Mary to mark 8 cells from 64. What is the probability that after the draw, in which 8 cells from 64 will also be selected $($all such possibilities are equally probable$)$, it turns out that Mary guessed
   a) exactly 4 cells? b) exactly 5 cells? c) all 8 cells?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
8 cells out of 64 can be selected in <IMG SRC="73608 1.gif">  1 ways. Therefore, the probability that one particular method come up is equal to <IMG SRC="73608 2.gif">. The number of cases in which exactly k of the cells proved to be equal to the number of ways in which k cells are selected
of 8 marked and 8 - k cells of 56 unmarked cells, that is, <IMG SRC="73608 3.gif">. Thus, the probability of guessing exactly k cells is equal to <IMG SRC="73608 4.gif">.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
a)	<IMG SRC="73608 5.gif"> b) <IMG SRC="73608 6.gif"> 6 c) <IMG SRC="73608 7.gif">
