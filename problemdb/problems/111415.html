<h1>Problem ID 111415</h1>
<p>
The volume of the regular quadrangular pyramid SABCD is equal to V. The height SP of the pyramid is the edge of the regular tetrahedron SPQR, the plane of the face PQR which is perpendicular to the edge SC. Find the volume of the common part of these pyramids.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
We denote $AB = a, \angle SCP = α$. Let the plane passing through the line BD be perpendicular to the edge SC of the pyramid SABCD, intersecting this edge at the point H. The height SP of the pyramid SABCD is the edge of the regular tetrahedron SPQR, and the height of the tetrahedron lies on the line SC. Therefore, the plane of the face of the PQR of the tetrahedron passes through the point P perpendicular to SC, and hence coincides with the plane BDH. Hence, SH is the height of the regular tetrahedron SPQR. The PH segment is the height of the right triangle SPC, drawn from the vertex of the right angle, so SPH = SCP = α, and since. SPH is the angle between the edge SP of the regular tetrahedron and the face of PQR, then
<p>
$cos α = cos \angle SPH = 1/\sqrt {3}, sin α = \sqrt {1-1/3} = \sqrt 2 \div \sqrt {3}, tan α = \sqrt 2$.
<p>
From the right-angled triangle SPC we find that
<p>
$SP = CP tan α = a \sqrt 2 /2 \times \sqrt 2 = a$,
<p>
That is, the edge of the regular tetrahedron SPQR is equal to a, and since H is the centre of an equilateral triangle PQR, then $PH = a \sqrt 3 \div 3$. Consider the cross-section of the pyramid and tetrahedron by the BDH plane. We obtain an isosceles triangle BDH with base $BD = a \sqrt 2$ and height $HP = a \sqrt 3 \div 3$, and an equilateral triangle PQR. We denote $\angle BHP = γ$. Then
tan γ = BP/HP = \frac{\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{a\sqrt{3}}{3}}  =, cos γ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+tan^2 γ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+3/2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5}}, sin γ =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5}}.
<p>
Let E and F be the points of intersection of the lines PQ and PR with the segments BH and DH, respectively. Since PH is the bisector of the angle QPR, the triangles HEP and HFP are equal along the side and two adjacent corners, hence HF = HE. By the sine theorem

Besides,
<p>
$sin \angle PEH = sin γ = \sqrt{3}/ \sqrt{5} $>$  ½ = sin 30^{\circ} = sin \angle HPE$,
<p>
so

Hence, the point E lies on the interval PQ. Therefore, the general part of the SABCD pyramid and the SPQR tetrahedron is the quadrangular SPEHF pyramid with the vertex S. Let V1 be the volume of this pyramid. Then
= $1/3 S_{SPEHF} \times SH = 1/3 \times 2S_{Δ HEP} \times SH = 1/3 \times 2 \times ½ HP \times HE sin γ \times SH$ = <img src=“98510 1.gif”> 4 desktop
<p>
Since the volume of the SABCD pyramid is V, then
<p>
$V = 1/3 S_{SABCD} \times SP = 1/3 a2 \times a = 1/3 a3$,

from where we get that a3 = 3V. Consequently,
