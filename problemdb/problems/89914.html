<h1>Problem ID 89914</h1>
<p>
Woodchucks are sawing a log. They made 10 cuts. How many pieces were made?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Into how many parts is the log divided into by the first cut? How does the number of pieces change after each subsequent cut?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The number of pieces is always 1 more than the number of cuts, because the first cut divides the log into two parts, and each next cut adds another piece.
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
11 pieces.
</p>
