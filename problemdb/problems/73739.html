<h1>Problem ID 73739</h1>
<p>
Let's call a natural number good if in its decimal record we have the numbers 1, 9, 7, 3 in succession, and bad if otherwise. $($For example, the number 197 639 917 is bad and the number 116 519 732 is good$)$. Prove that there exists a positive integer n such that among all n-digit numbers $($from $10^{n-1}$ to $10^{n-1}$$)$ there are more good than bad numbers.
Try to find the smallest possible n.

A separate note on pages 35-40 is devoted to the solution of the problem M204.
