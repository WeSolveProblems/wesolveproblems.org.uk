<h1>Problem ID 32056</h1>
<p>
 Each of the four gnomes - Dopey, Sleepy, Happy, Moody - either always speaks the truth, or always lies. We heard such a conversation: Dopey to Sleepy: "you are a liar"; Happy to Sleepy: "you are a liar"; Moody to Happy: "Yes, they are both liars," $($after a moment's thought$)$, "however, so are you." Which of them is telling the truth?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Suppose that Moody is telling the truth. Then, according to him, the three other gnomes are liars. And, thus, Happy's statement is true. Hence, the assumption leads to a contradiction, so Moody is a liar, and his assertion that Happy is a liar is false. Hence we conclude that Happy is telling the truth. Thus, Dopey is a liar, and Sleepy speaks the truth. Note that the phrase "Yes and they are both liars" $($regarding to Sleepy and Dopey$)$ is false $($despite the fact that Dopey is really a liar$)$, since Sleepy is not a liar.
