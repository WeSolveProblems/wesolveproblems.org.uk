<h1>Problem ID 103008</h1>
<p>
When Gulliver came to Lilliput, he found that there all things were exactly 12 times shorter than in his homeland. Can you say how many Lilliputian matchboxes fit into one of Gulliver’s matchboxes?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
Notice that into Gulliver’s matchbox 12 Lilliputian matchboxes can be placed in width, 12 in length and 12 in height.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
In Gulliver’s matchbox, there can be placed 12 Lilliputian boxes in width, 12 - in length and 12 - in height. That gives a total of $12 \times 12 \times 12$ = 1728 boxes.
