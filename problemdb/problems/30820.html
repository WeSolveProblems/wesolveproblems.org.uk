<h1>Problem ID 30820</h1> <p>
In some country there is a capital and another 100 cities. Some cities (including the capital) are connected by one-way roads. From each non-capital city 20 roads emerge, and 21 roads enter each such city. Prove that you cannot travel to the capital from any city.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
Let a roads enter the capital city. Then the total number of "incoming" roads is $21 \times 100 + a$, and the total number of "emerging" roads is not more than
$20 \times 100 + (100 - a)$. Therefore, $21 \times 100 + a ≤ 20 \times 100 + (100 - a)$, that is, 2a ≤ 0. Thus, a = 0.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
