<h1>Problem ID 32787</h1>
<p>Is it possible to find 57 different two digit numbers, such that no sum of any two of them was equal to 100?</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Assume that 57 such two-digit numbers can be found. Then in each pair of the form $(n, 100-n)$, where $n$ has a value of between 10 and 49 inclusive, no more than one number is chosen. There are 40 such pairs, therefore between 10 and 90 there can be no more than 41 numbers chosen - we can also choose 50. This leaves 9 numbers from 91 to 99 therefore we have chosen 50 numbers in total. However, we assumed that we could choose 57 such numbers which is a contradiction. Therefore our assumption was false.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>No, it is not possible. </p>
