<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  A group of $2n$ people were gathered together, of whom each person knew no less than $n$ of the other people present. Prove that it is possible to select 4 people and seat them around a table, so that each person sits next to people they know. ( $n \geq 2$)
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  If all of the people present know one another, then there is no question about finding a table of 4 people who all know one another.
</p>
<p>
  Let $A$ and $B$ be two of the people at the gathering, who do not know one another. Each one of them, has amongst the remaining $2n-2$ attendees, no fewer than $n$ people they know. Since $n +n = 2n = (2n-2)+2$, $A$ and $B$ must have no fewer than two mutual acquantances $C_1$ and $C_2$ - and we can seat $A$ and $B$ opposite one another, and place $C_1$ and $C_2$ between them on either side.
