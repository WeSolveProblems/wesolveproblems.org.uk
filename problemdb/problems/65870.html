<h1>Problem ID 65870</h1>
<p>
10 children were each given a bowl with 100 pieces of pasta. However, these children did not want to eat and instead started to play. One of the children started to place one piece of pasta into every other childâ€™s bowl. What is the least amount of transfers needed so that everyone has a different number of pieces of pasta in their bowl?
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Evaluation: consider the difference between the amount of pasta that Anna has and the amount that Katherine has. If Anna reduces this difference by 10, Katherine will increase it by 10, and the actions of the other children will not change the difference. Therefore, this difference will not be null if and only if Anna and Katherine carry out a different number of transfers. Therefore, in order for all children to have a different amount of pasta, they need to carry out at least 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 9 = 45 transfers.
</p>
Example: the first will make 0 transfers, the second - 1, the third - 2, ..., the tenth - 9. Each will give no more than $9 \times 9$ = 81 pieces of pasta and the initial 100 pieces of his/her pasta will suffice.

</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
After 45 transfers.
