The alphabet of the Ni-Boom-Boom tribe contains 22 consonants and 11 vowels. A word in this language is defined as any combination of letters in which there are no consecutive consonants and no letter is used more than once. The alphabet is divided into 6 non-empty groups. Prove that it is possible to construct a word from all the letters in the group in at least one of the groups.

<h1>Solution</h1>
Prove that in one of the groups the difference between the number of consonants and vowels is not greater than 1.
