<h1>Problem ID 65295</h1>
<p>
A die is thrown six times. Find the mathematical expectation of the number of different faces the die lands on.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p> 
Let ξi be a random variable, equal to 1 if die falls with the face with i points facing upwards at least once and 0, if this does not happen even once. Then the number of different dropped faces is ξ = ξ1 + ... + ξ6. Moving on to the expectations, we get: Eξ = 6Eξ1, since all the quantities ξi are distributed identically. The mathematical expectation Eξ1 is obviously equal to $P($ξ1 = 1) = 1 - (5/6)^6$.
