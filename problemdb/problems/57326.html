<h1>Problem ID 57326</h1>
<p>
In a triangle, the lengths of two of the sides are 3.14 and 0.67. Find the length of the third side if it is known that it is an integer.
</p>
 
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the length of the third side be n. By the triangle inequality 3.14 â€“ 0.67 $<$ n $<$ 3.14 + 0.67. Since n is an integer, then n = 3.
