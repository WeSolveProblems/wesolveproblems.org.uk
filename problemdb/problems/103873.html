<h1>Problem ID 103873</h1>
<p>
Jessica, Nicole and Alex received 6 coins between them: 3 gold coins and 3 silver coins. Each of them received 2 coins. Jessica doesn't know which coins the others received but only which coins she has. Think of a question which Jessica can answer with either "yes", "no" or "I don't know" such that from the answer you can know which coins Jessica has.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let us check if the question "Is it true that you have more gold coins than Alex?" fits the conditions.
<br>
If Jessica has 2 gold coins then she can answer "yes" since Alex cannot have more than 1 gold coin. If Jessica has 2 silver coins then Alex must have at least 1 gold coin and so Jessica would answer "no". If Jessica received 1 gold coin and 1 silver coin then she would answer "I don't know", since Alex might have either 2 gold coins or 2 silver coins. 
<br>
Of course, other questions can also fit the requirements, such as:
<br>
"Is it true that one of the others received 2 silver coins?"
<br>
"Is it true that the others each received at least 1 gold coin?"
<br>
"If I take 1 coin from you and give you a gold coin instead, would you have more gold coins now?"
<br>
(Notice that in the last question we do not refer to the coins received by Nicole and Alex, but only to those received by Jessica.)
</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
For example: "Is it true that you have more gold coins than Alex?".
