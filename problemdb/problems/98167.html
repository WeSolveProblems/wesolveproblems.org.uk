<h1>Problem ID 98167</h1>
<p>
Sage stated the sum of some three natural numbers, and the Patricia named their product.
"If I knew," said Sage, "that your number is greater than mine, then I would immediately name the three numbers that are needed."
"My number is smaller than yours," Patricia answered, "and the numbers you want are ..., ... and ...."
What numbers did Patricia name?

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
We denote the sum of the numbers by S, and the product by P. If S is equal to 3, 4 or 5, then P $<$ S and the sentence stated by Sage does not make sense. If S $≥$ 7, then among the variants of the sets which could make the sum S, there are the sets: $(1, 2, S-3)$ and $(2, 2, S-4)$. In both cases, P $>$ S, which contradicts the statement of Patricia. There remains the variant S = 6. In this case, P can be 4, 6 and 8. But Patricia said that her number is smaller than Sage’s. So Patricia named the numbers 1, 1 and 4 $($ after the words of Sage she understood that S ≠ 5, and rejected the option 1, 2, 2 $)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
1, 1 and 4.
