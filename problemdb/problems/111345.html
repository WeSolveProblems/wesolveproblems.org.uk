<h1>Problem ID 111345</h1>
<p>
The numbers p and q are such that the parabolas y = - $2x^2$ and y = $x^2$ + px + q intersect at two points, bounding a certain figure.
Find the equation of the vertical line dividing the area of this figure in half.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
If $x_1$ $<$ $x_2$ are the abscissas of intersection points of the given parabolas, then for each number $x_0$ from the interval $($x_1, x_2$)$, the area of the part of the original figure located to the left of the vertical line x = $x_0$ is equal to the area of the corresponding part of the new figure bounded by the axis, abscissas and the parabola y = - $3x^2$ - px - q. This parabola intersects the x-axis at the points $x_1$, $x_2$, and hence is symmetric with respect to the straight line x = 1/2 $($x_1 + x_2$)$. Consequently, the area of the new figure $($as well as the original one$)$ will be divided in half when

<h1>Answer</h1> 
<p>
x = -p/6.
</p>

<h1>Remarks</h1> 
<p>
The equality of the areas of the corresponding parts of the original and the new figure can be justified without using an integral, for example, with the help of the Cavalieri principle.
