<h1>Problem ID 35066</h1>
<p>
A family went to the bridge at night. The dad can cross it in 1 minute, the mum in 2 minutes, the child in 5 minutes, and the grandmother in 10 minutes. They have one flashlight. The bridge only withstands two people. How can they cross the bridge in 17 minutes? $($If two people cross, then they pass with the lower of the two speeds. They cannot pass along the bridge without a flashlight. They cannot shine the light from afar. They cannot carry anyone in their arms. They cannot throw the flashlight$)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
Look closely at the time, during which the bridge is crossed by the grandmother and the child. It seems that in order for the entire family to cross the bridge, they must cross the bridge only once and at the same time. But then someone will have to return the flashlight to the other side ...

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The father and mother pass in 2 minutes. The dad returns with the flashlight in one 1 minute. The grandmother and child pass in 10 minutes. The mum comes back with the flashlight in 2 minutes. The father and mother cross the bridge in 2 minutes. In total, we have 17 minutes.
