<h1>Problem ID 65328</h1>
<p>
Anna is waiting for the bus. Which event is most likely?
<p>
   A = {Anna waits for the bus for at least a minute},
   <p>
   B = {Anna waits for the bus for at least two minutes},
   <p>
   C = {Anna waits for the bus for at least five minutes}.

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
Event A includes event B, and event B includes event C, that is, event A is the most extensive: C ⊂ B ⊂ A. Therefore,
P$($C$)$ $\leq$ P$($B$)$ $\leq$ P$($A$)$.

</p>


<h1>Answer</h1>
Event A.
