<h1>Problem ID 98031</h1>
<p>
  10 friends sent one another greetings cards; each sent 5 cards. Prove that there will be two friends who sent cards to one another.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<h2>Solution 1 </h2>
<p>
  Consider that the statement is false, that is there is no pair of friends that sent one another cards. Each of the friends sent 5 cards, therefore they could receive a maximum of 4 cards each as neither they, nor the 5 friends they sent a card to, can send them a card back, leaving 4 possible friends. This means that maximum total number of cards received is 40. This is despite there being $5 \times 10 =50$ cards sent. This is a contradiction.
</p>
<h2>Solution 2 </h2>
<p>
  The number of pairs of friends $=\frac{10 \times 9}{2}=45$ Since in total 50 cards were sent there must be some pairs with at least two cards sent. That is in that pair the friends sent cards to one another.
</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>
  1. From solution 2 it follows that the number of pairs of friends who sent cards to one another is no less than 5 - no friend sends a card to the same person more than once.
