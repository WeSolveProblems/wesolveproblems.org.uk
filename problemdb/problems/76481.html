<h1>Problem ID 76481</h1>
<p>
A quadrilateral is given; A, B, C, D are the successive midpoints of its sides, P and Q are the midpoints of its diagonals. Prove that the triangle BCP is equal to the triangle ADQ.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
The segments AD and CB are parallel to one of the diagonals, and their lengths are half that of the diagonal. The segments DQ and BP are parallel to one side of the quadrilateral, and their length is half of the length of a side. The segments AQ and CP are also parallel to the side of the quadrilateral and their length is half the length of this side.
