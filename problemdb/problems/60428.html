<h1>Problem ID 60428</h1>
<p>
 In a box, there are 10 white and 15 black balls. Four balls are removed from the box. What is the probability that all of the removed balls will be white?

</p> <h1>Solution 1</h1> <p> 
   There are only <IMG SRC="60428 1.gif"> ways to choose four balls. Of these, we are satisfied with <IMG SRC="60428 2.gif"> options. Therefore, the required probability is equal to <IMG SRC="60428 3.gif">.
</p>

</p> <h1>Solution 2</h1> <p> 
   The probability that the first drawn ball is white is 10/25 = 2/5. Under this condition, the probability that the second ball is white, is 9/24 = 3/8. Continuing similarly and multiplying the probabilities obtained, we find the required probability:
