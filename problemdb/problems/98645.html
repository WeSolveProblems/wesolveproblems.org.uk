<h1>Problem ID 98645</h1>
<p>
The case of Brown, Jones and Smith is being considered. One of them committed a crime. During the investigation, each of them made two statements. Brown: "I did not do it. Jones did not do it. " Smith: "I did not do it. Brown did it. "Jones:" Brown did not do it. This was done by Smith. "Then it turned out that one of them had told the truth in both statements, another had lied both times, and the third had told the truth once, and he had lied once. Who committed the crime?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Think if Jones could be the thief.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
The thief is Brown. If we consider three possibilities - “Jones being the thief", “Brown being the thief” and “Smith being the thief”, then we will see that only in the case where Brown is the thief are the conditions of the task fulfilled. If the thief is Smith, then both Brown and Jones told the truth. If the thief is Jones, then both Brown and Smith told one truth and one lie.
