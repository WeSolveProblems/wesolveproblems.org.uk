<p>
Decipher the puzzle shown in the picture. Same letters correspond to same numbers, different letters to different numbers.

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
What is C?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since there is one two-digit and two single-digit numbers among the summands in the puzzle, and the sum is a three-digit number, this three-digit number must begin with 1, and the two-digit number starts at no less than 8. So, C = 1, B = 8 or 9. If B were 8, then C for any A would have to be even $($see the last column$)$.

But C = 1, then B = 9. Knowing B and C, we determine that A = 6. So, when replacing letters with numbers, we get: 6 + 99 + 6 = 111.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>	
 A = 6; B = 9; C = 1.
