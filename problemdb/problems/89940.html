<h1>Problem ID 89940</h1>
<p>
True or false? Prince Charming went to find Cinderella. He reached the crossroads and started to daydream. Suddenly he sees the Big Bad Wolf. And everyone knows that this Big Bad Wolf on one day answers every question truthfully, and a day later he lies, he proceeds in such a manner on alternate days. Prince Charming can ask the Big Bad Wolf exactly one question, after which it is necessary for him to choose which of the two roads to go on. What question can Prince Charming ask the Big Bad Wolf to find out for sure which of the roads leads to the Magic kingdom?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Try to ask not only about the road, but also about the Big Bad Wolf himself. 

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Prince Charming can, for example, ask: "What answer would you, Big Bad Wolf, give me yesterday to the question, which of the two roads leads to the magic kingdom?" And regardless of whether the Big Bad Wolf is telling the truth today or lying, the answer to this question will always be incorrect. It is interesting that if Prince Charming uses "the day before yesterday" instead of the word "yesterday", ie he asks: "What would you, Big Bad Wolf, answer me the day before yesterday to the question of which of the two roads leads to magic kingdom? ", the answer will always be true, regardless of whether the Big Bad Wolf speaks the truth today, or if he spoke it yesterday.
