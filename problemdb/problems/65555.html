<h1>Problem ID 65555</h1>
<p>
Author: A.V. Shapovalov
<p>
We call a triangle rational if all of its angles are measured by a rational number of degrees. We call a point inside the triangle rational if, when we join it by segments with vertices, we get three rational triangles. Prove that within any acute-angled rational triangle there are at least three distinct rational points.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
In a non-isosceles triangle, we are happy with the point of intersection of heights, the point of intersection of the bisectors and the centre of the circumscribed circle $($these points are different, since the side lying opposite to the angle different from 60Â° is visible from them at different angles$)$. In an isosceles triangle, any three points that are at a height will do, from which the base can be seen at "rational" angles $($the lateral sides, due to symmetry, are seen at equal angles, which means that these angles are also "rational"$)$.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above. 


</p> <h1>Remarks</h1> <p> 
4 points.
