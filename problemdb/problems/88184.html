<h1>Problem ID 88184</h1>
<p>
Cowboy Joe was sentenced to death in an electric chair. He knows that out of two electric chairs standing in a special cell, one is defective. In addition, Joe knows that if he sits on this faulty chair, the penalty will not be repeated and he will be pardoned. He also knows that the guard guarding the chairs on every other day tells the truth to every question and on the alternate days he answers incorrectly to every question. The sentenced person is allowed to ask the guard exactly one question, after which it is necessary to choose which electric chair to sit on. What question can Joe ask the guard to find out for sure which chair is faulty?

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p>
Remember task numbers 140, 148, 149.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>
Joe may, for example, ask: "What answer would you give me yesterday to the question, which chair is defective?" And regardless of whether the guard is telling the truth today or lying, the answer to this question will always be wrong. It is interesting that if Joe uses "the day before yesterday" instead of "yesterday" in this question, that is, if he asks: "What answer would you give me the day before yesterday to the question, which chair is defective?", the answer will always be true, regardless of whether the guard is telling the truth today or if he spoke it yesterday.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>
 "What answer would you have given me yesterday to the question, which chair is faulty?"
