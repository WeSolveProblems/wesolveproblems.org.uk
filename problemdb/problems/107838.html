<h1>Problem ID 107838</h1>
<p>
Author: A. Y. Kanel-Belov
<p>
Consider the powers of the number five: 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, ... We form the sequence of their first digits: 1, 5, 2, 1, 6, ...
<p>
Prove that any part of this sequence, written in reverse order, will occur in the sequence of the first digits of the powers of the number two $(1, 2, 4, 8, 1, 3, 6, 1, ...)$.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
  It suffices to prove that any initial part of the sequence of the first digits of the powers of the number five is encountered $($in reverse order$)$ in the sequence of the first digits of the powers of the number two.
<p>
  Consider the numbers: $2^{-1}, 2^{-2}, ..., 2^{-n}$. The sequence of the first non-zero digits of their decimal records is exactly the sequence of the first digits of the decimal numbers of the numbers $5, 25, ..., 5^n$.
<p> 
  Therefore, to solve the problem it suffices to show that for any k there exists a power of the number two of $x = 2^n$ whose decimal notation has the form 1
<img src="107838 1.gif"> y, where y is the rest of the decimal notation. In other words, $x = 10^N + y$, and $y $<$ 10^{N-k}$.
<p>
  In this case, $2^{n-1} = 2^n \div 2 = 500 ... 0 *, 2^{n-2} = 250 ... 0 *, 2^{n-3} = 1250 ... 0 *$, that is, $2^{n-1}$ coincides with the first digit of the number $5^l$ for l $<$ k.
<p>
  The existence of a necessary power of the number two is a special case of problem number 77898.
