<h1>Problem ID 78086</h1>
<p>
1956 points are selected from a cube, whose edge is equal to 13 units. Is it possible to place a cube with edge of 1 unit in this cube so that there is not one selected point inside it?
</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Answer: Yes, it is possible. Let's cut this cube to $13^3$ = 2197 cubes with edge 1. If there was a selected point inside each of these cubes, then the number of selected points would be not less than 2197, which contradicts the condition. Consequently, at least one selected point does not lie inside at least one of these cubes.
