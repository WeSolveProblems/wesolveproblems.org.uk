<h1>Problem ID 57416</h1>
<p>
Prove that in any triangle the sum of the lengths of the heights is less than the perimeter.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
It is clear that $h_a$ $\leq$ b, $h_b$ $\leq$ c, $h_c$ $\leq$ a, and at least one of these inequalities is strict. Therefore, $h_a + h_b + h_c$ $<$ a + b + c.
