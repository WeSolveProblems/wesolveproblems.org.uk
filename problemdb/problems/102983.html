<h1>Problem ID 102983</h1>
<p>
There are some weighing scales without weights and 3 identical in appearance coins, one of which is fake: it is lighter than a real coin $($real coins are equal in weight$)$. How many weighings are needed to determine a counterfeit coin?
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
When searching for a counterfeit coin among three coins, try putting one coin on each arm of the weighing scales.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1> 
<p>
We will be able to solve this problem after just the first weighing. We put one coin on each arm of the scales. If one of the cups is lighter, then the coin on it must be fake. If the scales balance in equilibrium, it means that the counterfeit coin is the one that was not put on the scales.
