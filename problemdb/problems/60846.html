<h1>Problem ID 60846</h1>
<p>
Prove that in any infinite decimal fraction you can rearrange the numbers so that the resulting fraction becomes a rational number.

</p> <h1>Hint</h1> <p> 
Consider separately those numbers that occur a finite number of times and those that occur infinitely many times.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
A fraction expresses a rational number if and only if it is periodic, beginning with some sign. The numbers from 0 to 9 are divided into two classes: in the first class we include those numbers that occur in the original fraction a finite number of times, in the second class - those that occur in the original fraction infinitely many times. We begin to write out a periodic fraction, which can be obtained from the original permutation of the digits. First, after the zero and the decimal point, we will write in an arbitrary order all of the digits from the first class - each as many times as it appears in the record of the original fraction. The recorded first-class digits will be the part of the fraction that occurs before the recurring numbers. Next, in a certain order, we will write down the numbers from the second class once. We will declare this combination a period and we will repeat it an infinite number of times. Thus, we write out the desired periodic fraction.

</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p> 
See the solution above.
