<h1>Problem ID 32808</h1>
<p>
Prove that in a game of noughts and crosses on a 3x3 grid, if the first player uses the right strategy then the second player cannot win.

</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Let the first player in their first turn draw a cross in the centre of the grid. The second player has two options: to put a nought in the corner or in the centre of a side of the grid. The it is not easy to check all possibilities to see that in each case the first player can prevent the second player from winning.
