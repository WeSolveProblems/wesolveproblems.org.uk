<h1>Problem ID 78689</h1>
<p>
 A White Rook pursues a black bishop on a board of $3 \times 1969$ cells $($they walk in turn according to the usual rules$)$. How should the rook play to take the bishop? White makes the first move.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
In the first turn, the rook gets to an arbitrary cell of the middle line, which runs along the board. Then it moves in one direction, behind the bishop on the course of the knight.
</p>
