<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
  A scone contains raisins and sultanas. Prove that inside the scone there will always be two points 1cm apart, such that either both lie inside raisins, both inside sultanas or both lie outside of either raisins or sultanas.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
  Consider a regular tetraheadron with an edge length of 1cm, that lies entirely inside the scone. For each of its vertices there are three possibilities - either the vertex is inside a raisin, inside a sultana, or inside neither. Since the tetrahedron has 4 vertices, but there are only three possibilites, at least one of those possibilities must occur on two vertices. These two vertices are the two required points.
