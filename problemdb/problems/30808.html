<h1>Problem ID 30808</h1> <p>
On the plane 100 circles are given, which make up a connected figure $($that is, not falling apart into pieces$)$. Prove that this figure can be drawn without taking the pencil off of the paper and going over any line twice.

</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p> 
The graph is connected as the degrees of all of its vertices are even $($see problem number 30806$)$.
</p> <h1>Answer</h1> <p>  
See the solution above.
