<h1>Problem ID 35667</h1>
<p>
The key of the cipher, called the "swivelling grid", is a stencil made from a square sheet of chequered paper of size $n \times n$ $($where n is even$)$. Some of the cells are cut out. One side of the stencil is marked. When this stencil is placed onto a blank sheet of paper in four possible ways $($marked side up, right, down or left$)$, its cut-outs completely cover the entire area of the square, where each cell is found under the cut-out exactly once. The letters of the message, that have length $n^2$, are successively written into the cut-outs of the stencil, where the sheet of paper is placed on a blank sheet of paper with the marked side up. After filling in all of the cut-outs of the stencil with the letters of the message, the stencil is placed in the next position, etc. After removing the stencil from the sheet of paper, there is an encrypted message.

Find the number of different keys for an arbitrary even number n.
</p>

<h1>Hint</h1>
<p>
All cells of a square of size $n times n$ can be divided into non-intersecting groups of four cells, which are combined by rotations around the centre of the square. In the key-stencil, exactly one cell from each group should be cut out.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
All cells of a square of size $n \times n$ can be divided into non-intersecting groups of four cells. We will assign cells to the same group, if at each turn of the square before its self-alignment each cell moves to the location of another cell in the same group. The total number of such groups will be $n^2$/4. When the stencil is applied to the square, exactly one cell from each group will appear under its cut-outs. We associate an ordered set of all cells with each stencil from such groups that appeared under the cut-outs of the stencil when it was placed on the square with the marked side up. There are $n^2$/4 such cells $($one in each group$)$, hence, in total, there are $4n^{2/4}$ of these sets.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
$4n^{2/4}$.
