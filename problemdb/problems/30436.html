<h1>Problem ID 30436</h1>
<p>
Two players take turns to put rooks on a chessboard so that the rooks cannot capture each other. The player who cannot make a move loses.
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
After each move both the number of verticals and the number of horizontals on which the rooks can be placed is reduced by 1. Therefore, the game will consist of exactly 8 turns. The last, winning move will be made by the second player.
