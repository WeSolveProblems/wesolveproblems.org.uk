<h1>Problem ID 64505</h1>
<p>
The height of the room is 3 meters. When it was being renovated, it turned out that more paint was needed on each wall than on the floor. Can the area of the floor of this room be more than 10 square meters?
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
Since each wall requires more paint than the floor, the area of the floor is smaller than the area of each wall. This means that both the length and width of the room is less than its height, that is less than 3m. Similarly, the width of the room is less than 3m. Therefore, the area of the room is less than 9 $m^2$.

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
No, this cannot be.
